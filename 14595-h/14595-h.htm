<h2>PREFACE.</h2>
<p>This volume is not altogether a military romance, though it
contains the adventures of one of those noble-hearted and patriotic
young men who went forth from homes of plenty and happiness to
fight the battles of our imperilled country. The incidents of the
story may be stirring and exciting; yet they are not only within
the bounds of probability, but have been more than paralleled in
the experience of hundreds of the gallant soldiers of the loyal
army.</p>
<p>The work is not intended to approach the dignity of a history,
though the writer has carefully consulted the
&ldquo;authorities,&rdquo; both loyal and rebel, and has taken down
the living words of enthusiastic participants in the stirring
scenes described in this volume. He has not attempted to give a
full picture of any battle, or other army operation, but simply of
those movements in which the hero took a part. The book is a
narrative of personal adventure, delineating the birth and growth
of a pure patriotism in the soul of the hero, and describing the
perils and privations, the battles and marches which he shared with
thousands of brave men in the army of the Potomac.</p>
<p>The author has endeavored to paint a picture of the true
soldier, one who loves his country, and fights for her because he
loves her; but, at the same time, one who is true to himself and
his God, while he is faithful to his patriotic impulses.</p>
<p>The work has been a pleasure to me in its preparation, and I
hope it will not disappoint the reasonable expectation of those
partial friends whose smile is my joy, whose frown is my grief.
But, more than all, I trust this humble volume will have some small
influence in kindling and cherishing that genuine patriotism which
must ever be the salvation of our land, the foundation of our
national prosperity and happiness.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Fort Sumter has surrendered, mother!&rdquo; shouted
Thomas Somers, as he rushed into the room where his mother was
quietly reading her Bible.</p>
<p>It was Sunday, and the exciting news had been circulated about
the usually quiet village of Pinchbrook Harbor. Men&rsquo;s lips
were compressed, and their teeth shut tight together. They were
indignant, for traitors had fired upon the flag of the United
States. Men, women, and children were roused by the indignity
offered to the national emblem. The cannon balls that struck the
walls of Sumter seemed at the same time to strike the souls of the
whole population of the North, and never was there such a great
awakening since the Pilgrim Fathers first planted their feet upon
the rock of Plymouth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fort Sumter has surrendered!&rdquo; shouted the indignant
young patriot again, as his mother looked up from the blessed
volume.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t say so!&rdquo; exclaimed Mrs. Somers, as
she closed the Bible, and removed her spectacles.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, mother. The infernal rebels hammered away at the
fort for two days, and at last we had to give in.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;ll be terrible times afore long,&rdquo;
replied the old lady, shaking her head with prophetic
earnestness.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The President has called for seventy-five thousand
volunteers, and I tell you there&rsquo;ll be music before
long!&rdquo; continued the youth, so excited that he paced the room
with rapid strides.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter, Thomas?&rdquo; asked a feeble
old gentleman, entering the room at this moment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fort Sumter has surrendered, gran&rsquo;ther,&rdquo;
repeated Thomas, at the top of his lungs, for the aged man was
quite deaf; &ldquo;and the President has called for seventy-five
thousand men to go down and fight the traitors.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sho!&rdquo; exclaimed the old man, halting, and gazing
with earnestness into the face of the boy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a fact, gran&rsquo;ther.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;m too old to go,&rdquo; muttered
gran&rsquo;ther Greene; &ldquo;but I wa&rsquo;n&rsquo;t
older&rsquo;n you are when I shouldered my firelock in 1812.
I&rsquo;m too old and stiff to go now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How old were you, gran&rsquo;ther, when you went to the
war?&rdquo; asked Thomas, with more moderation than he had
exhibited before.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Only sixteen, Thomas; but I was as tall as I am
now,&rdquo; replied the patriarch, dropping slowly and cautiously
into the old-fashioned high-back chair, by the side of the cooking
stove.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;m sixteen, and I mean to go.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You, Thomas! You are crazy! You shan&rsquo;t do any thing
of the kind,&rdquo; interposed Mrs. Somers. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s
men enough to go to the war, without such boys as you
are.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You ain&rsquo;t quite stout enough to make a soldier,
Thomas. You ain&rsquo;t so big as I was, when I went off to York
state,&rdquo; added gran&rsquo;ther Greene.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I should like to go any how,&rdquo; said Thomas, as he
seated himself in a corner of the room, and began to think thoughts
big enough for a full-grown man.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fort Sumter has surrendered,&rdquo; shouted John Somers,
rushing into the house as much excited as his brother had been.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve heard all about it, John,&rdquo; replied his
mother.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The President has called for seventy-five thousand men,
and in my opinion the rebels will get an awful licking before they
are a fortnight older. I should like to go and help do
it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The exciting news was discussed among the members of the Somers
family, as it was in thousands of other families, on that eventful
Sunday. Thomas and John could think of nothing, speak of nothing,
but Fort Sumter, and the terrible castigation which the rebels
would receive from the insulted and outraged North. They were loyal
even to enthusiasm; and when they retired to their chamber at
night, they ventured to express to each other their desire to join
the great army which was to avenge the insult offered to the flag
of the Union.</p>
<p>They were twin brothers, sixteen years of age; but they both
thought they were old enough and strong enough to be soldiers.
Their mother, however, had promptly disapproved of such
suggestions, and they had not deemed it prudent to discuss the idea
in her presence.</p>
<p>On Monday, the excitement instead of subsiding, was fanned to a
fever heat; Pinchbrook Harbor was in a glow of patriotism. Men
neglected their usual occupations, and talked of the affairs of the
nation. Every person who could procure a flag hung it out at his
window, or hoisted it in his yard, or on his house. The governor
had called out a portion of the state militia, and already the
tramp of armed men was heard in the neighboring city of Boston.</p>
<p>Thomas Somers was employed in a store in the village, and during
the forenoon he mechanically performed the duties of his position;
but he could think of nothing but the exciting topic of the day.
His blood was boiling with indignation against those who had
trailed our hallowed flag in the dust. He wanted to do something to
redeem the honor of his country&mdash;something to wipe out the
traitors who had dared to conspire against her peace. On his way
home to dinner, he met Fred Pemberton, who lived only a short
distance from his own house.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you think now, Fred?&rdquo; said Thomas.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do I think? I think just as I always did&mdash;the
North is wrong, and the South is right,&rdquo; replied Fred.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who fired upon Fort Sumter? That&rsquo;s the
question,&rdquo; said Thomas, his eyes flashing with
indignation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why didn&rsquo;t they give up the fort, then?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Give up the fort! Shall the United States cave in before
the little State of South Carolina. Not by a two chalks!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think the North has been teasing and vexing the South
till the Southerns can&rsquo;t stand it any longer. There&rsquo;ll
be war now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope there will! By gracious, I hope so!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope the South will beat!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you? Do you, Fred Pemberton?&rdquo; demanded Tom, so
excited he could not stand still.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I do. The South has the rights of it. If we had let
their niggers alone, there wouldn&rsquo;t have been any
trouble.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are as blind as a bat, Fred. Don&rsquo;t you see this
isn&rsquo;t a quarrel between the North and the South, but between
the government and the rebels?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see it. If the North had let the South
alone, there wouldn&rsquo;t have been any fuss. I hope the North
will get whipped, and I know she will.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fred, you are a traitor to your country!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I&rsquo;m not!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, you are; and if I had my way, I&rsquo;d ride you on
a rail out of town.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, you wouldn&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I would. I always thought you were a decent fellow;
but you are a dirty, low-lived traitor.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Better be careful what you say, Tom Somers!&rdquo;
retorted the young secessionist, angrily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A fellow that won&rsquo;t stand by his country
ain&rsquo;t fit to live. You are an out-and-out traitor.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t call me that again, Tom Somers,&rdquo;
replied Fred, doubling up his fist.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I say you are a traitor.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Take that, then.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tom did take it, and it was a pretty hard blow on the side of
his head. Perhaps it was fortunate for our young patriot that an
opportunity was thus afforded him to evaporate some of his
enthusiasm in the cause of his country, for there is no knowing
what might have been the consequence if it had remained longer pent
up in his soul. Of course, he struck back; and a contest, on a
small scale, between the loyalty of the North and the treason of
the South commenced. How long it might have continued, or what
might have been the result, cannot now be considered; for the
approach of a chaise interrupted the battle, and the forces of
secession were re&euml;nforced by a full-grown man.</p>
<p>The gentleman stepped out of his chaise with his whip in his
hand, and proceeded to lay it about the legs and body of the
representative of the Union side. This was more than Tom Somers
could stand, and he retreated in good order from the spot, till he
had placed himself out of the reach of the whip.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you mean, you young scoundrel?&rdquo; demanded
the gentleman who had interfered.</p>
<p>Tom looked at him, and discovered that it was Squire Pemberton,
the father of his late opponent.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He hit me first,&rdquo; said Tom.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He called me a traitor,&rdquo; added Fred. &ldquo;I
won&rsquo;t be called a traitor by him, or any other
fellow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you mean by calling my son a traitor, you
villain?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I meant just what I said. He is a traitor. He said he
hoped the South would beat.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Suppose he did. I hope so too,&rdquo; added Squire
Pemberton.</p>
<p>The squire thought, evidently, that this ought to settle the
question. If he hoped so, that was enough.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then you are a traitor, too. That&rsquo;s all I&rsquo;ve
got to say,&rdquo; replied Tom, boldly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You scoundrel! How dare you use such a word to me!&rdquo;
roared the squire, as he moved towards the blunt-spoken little
patriot.</p>
<p>For strategic reasons, Tom deemed it prudent to fall back; but
as he did so, he picked up a couple of good-sized stones.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I said you were a traitor, and I say so again,&rdquo;
said Tom.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Two can play at that game,&rdquo; added Fred, as he
picked up a stone and threw it at Tom.</p>
<p>The Union force returned the fire with the most determined
energy, until one of the missiles struck the horse attached to the
chaise. The animal, evidently having no sympathy with either party
in this miniature contest, and without considering how much damage
he might do the rebel cause, started off at a furious pace when the
stone struck him. He dashed down the hill at a fearful rate, and
bounded away over the plain that led to the Harbor.</p>
<p>Squire Pemberton and his son had more interest in the fate of
the runaway horse than they had in the issue of the contest, and
both started at the top of their speed in pursuit. But they might
as well have chased a flash of lightning, or a locomotive going at
the rate of fifty miles an hour.</p>
<p>Tom Somers came down from the bank which he had ascended to
secure a good position. He had done rather more than he intended to
do; but on the whole he did not much regret it. He watched the
course of the spirited animal, as he dashed madly on to
destruction. The career of the horse was short; for in the act of
turning a corner, half a mile from the spot where Tom stood, he
upset the chaise, and was himself thrown down, and, being entangled
in the harness, was unable to rise before a stout man had him by
the head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wish that chaise had been the southern
confederacy,&rdquo; said Tom to himself, philosophically, when he
saw the catastrophe in the distance. &ldquo;Well, it served you
right, old Secesh; and I&rsquo;ll bet there ain&rsquo;t many folks
in Pinchbrook Harbor that will be willing to comfort the
mourners.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With this consoling assurance, Tom continued on his way home. At
dinner, he gave the family a faithful account of the
transaction.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You didn&rsquo;t do right, Thomas,&rdquo; said his
mother.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He hit me first.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You called him a traitor.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He is a traitor, and so is his father.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I declare, the boys are as full of fight as an egg is of
meat,&rdquo; added gran&rsquo;ther Greene.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You haven&rsquo;t seen the last of it yet, Thomas,&rdquo;
said the prudent mother.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No matter, Tom; I&rsquo;ll stand by you,&rdquo; added
John.</p>
<p>After dinner, the two boys walked down to the Harbor
together.</p>

<p class="returnTOC"><a href="#Contents">Return to Table of

<p>The town of Pinchbrook is not a great distance from Boston, with
which it is connected by railroad. If any of our young readers are
of a geographical turn of mind, and are disposed to ascertain the
exact locality of the place, we will save them any unnecessary
trouble, for it is not laid down on any map with which we are
familiar. We live in times of war, and probably our young friends
have already learned the meaning of &ldquo;military
necessity.&rdquo; Our story is essentially a military story, and
there are certain military secrets connected with it which might be
traced out if we should inform our inquisitive readers exactly
where Pinchbrook is situated.</p>
<p>Squire Pemberton, we doubt not, is very anxious to find out
certain persons connected with some irregular proceedings in and
around his house on the evening of Monday, April 16th. Fidelity to
the truth of history compels us to narrate these proceedings in our
humble volume; but we should exceedingly regret thereby to get any
of our friends into a scrape by informing the squire that they were
active participants in the scenes of that eventful night, or to say
any thing which would enable him, a lawyer, to trace out the
authors of the mischief through these pages. Therefore we cannot
say where Pinchbrook is, or even give a hint which would enable our
readers to fix definitely its locality.</p>
<p>Pinchbrook is a town of about three thousand inhabitants,
engaged, as the school books would say, in agriculture,
manufactures, commerce, and the fisheries, which, rendered into
still plainer English, means that some of the people are farmers;
that wooden pails, mackerel kegs, boots and shoes, are made; that
the inhabitants buy groceries, and sell fish, kegs, pails, and
similar wares; and that there are about twenty vessels owned in the
place, the principal part of which are fishermen.</p>
<p>We have not the agricultural and commercial statistics of the
place at hand; but the larger territorial part of the town was
devoted to the farming interest, and was rather sparsely populated,
while the principal village, called Pinchbrook Harbor, was more
densely peopled, contained two stores, four churches, one wharf, a
blacksmith shop, and several shoe and bucket manufactories.</p>
<p>We are willing to acknowledge that Pinchbrook is rather a
singular name. The antiquarians have not yet had an opportunity to
determine its origin; but our private opinion is that the word is a
corruption of <em>Punch</em>-brook. Perhaps, at some remote period
in the history of the town, before the Sons of Temperance obtained
a foothold in the place, a villainous mixture, known to topers
under the general appellation of &ldquo;punch,&rdquo; may have been
largely consumed by the Pinchbrookers. Though not a very aged
person ourself, we have heard allusions to festive occasions where,
metaphorically, the punch was said to &ldquo;flow in
streams.&rdquo; Possibly, from &ldquo;streams&rdquo; came
&ldquo;brooks,&rdquo;&mdash;hence,
&ldquo;Punchbrook,&rdquo;&mdash;which, under the strange mutations
of time, has become &ldquo;Pinchbrook.&rdquo; But we are not
learned in these matters, and we hope that nothing we have said
will bias the minds of antiquarians, and prevent them from devoting
that attention to the origin of the word which its importance
demands.</p>
<p>The Somers family, which we have already partially introduced,
occupied a small cottage not quite a mile from Pinchbrook Harbor.
Captain Somers, the head of the family, had been, and was still,
for aught his wife and children knew, master of the schooner
Gazelle. To purchase this vessel, he had heavily mortgaged his
house and lands in Pinchbrook to Squire Pemberton. But his voyages
had not been uniformly successful, though the captain believed that
his earthly possessions, after discharging all his liabilities,
would amount to about five thousand dollars.</p>
<p>The mortgage note would become due in June, and Captain Somers
had been making a strong effort to realize upon his property, so as
to enable him to pay off the obligation at maturity. Captain Somers
had a brother who was familiarly known in the family as uncle
Wyman. He had spent his life, from the age of eighteen, in the
South, and at the time of which we write, he was a merchant in
Norfolk.</p>
<p>Captain Somers and his brother had been interested together in
certain mercantile transactions, and uncle Wyman being the business
man, had the proceeds of these ventures in his own hands.</p>
<p>On the 10th of April, only two days before the bombardment of
Fort Sumter, Captain Somers had sailed in the Gazelle, with an
assorted cargo, for Norfolk. Before leaving home he had assured his
wife that he should not return without effecting a settlement with
Wyman, who had postponed it so many times, that the honest sailor
began to fear his brother did not mean to deal justly with him.
Nothing had been heard of the Gazelle since her departure from
Boston.</p>
<p>Uncle Wyman was known to be a northern man with southern
principles, while his brother, though not in the habit of saying
much about politics, was fully committed on the side of the
government, and was willing to sustain the President in the use of
all the coercion that might be necessary to enforce obedience to
the laws. The threatening aspect of affairs at the South had made
Captain Somers more than ever anxious to have his accounts
adjusted, as all his earthly possessions, except the schooner, were
in the hands of his brother; and the fact that uncle Wyman was so
strong an advocate of Southern rights, had caused him to make the
declaration that he would not return without a settlement.</p>
<p>The financial affairs of the Somers family, therefore, were not
in a very prosperous condition, and the solvency of the house
depended entirely upon the adjustment with uncle Wyman. The
mortgage note which Squire Pemberton held would be due in June, and
as the creditor was not an indulgent man, there was a prospect that
even the little cottage and the little farm might be wrested from
them.</p>
<p>The family at home consisted of Mrs. Somers and three children.
The two oldest daughters were married to two honest, hard-working
fishermen at the Harbor. Thomas and John were twins, sixteen years
of age. The former had a place in one of the stores at the village,
and the latter occasionally went a fishing trip with his
brothers-in-law. Both of the boys had been brought up to work, and
there was need enough now that they should contribute what they
could to the support of the family. The youngest child, Jane, was
but eleven years of age, and went to school. Mrs. Somers&rsquo;s
brother, a feeble old man, a soldier in the war of 1812, and a
pensioner of the government, had been a member of the family for
twenty years; and was familiarly known in town as
&ldquo;Gran&rsquo;ther Green.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Having thus made our readers acquainted with Pinchbrook and the
Somers family, we are prepared to continue our story.</p>
<p>Thomas and John walked down to the Harbor together after dinner.
The latter had listened with interest and approbation to his
brother&rsquo;s account of the &ldquo;Battle of Pinchbrook,&rdquo;
as he facetiously called it; and perhaps he thought Thomas might
need his assistance before he reached the store, for Fred and his
father would not probably be willing to let the matter rest where
they had left it.</p>
<p>We are sorry not to be able to approve all the acts of the hero
of this volume; but John, without asking our opinion, fully
indorsed the action of his brother.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fred is a traitor, and so is his father,&rdquo; said he,
as they passed out at the front gate of the little cottage.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s so, Jack; and it made my blood boil to hear
them talk,&rdquo; replied Thomas. &ldquo;And I couldn&rsquo;t help
calling things by their right names.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bully for you, Tom!&rdquo; added John, as he turned
round, and glanced at the house to assure himself they were out of
the hearing of their mother. &ldquo;Between you and me, Tom, there
will be music in Pinchbrook to-night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He lowered his voice, and spoke in tones big with mystery and
heavy with importance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo; asked Thomas, his interest
excited by the words and manner of his brother.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is fun ahead.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell me what it&rsquo;s all about.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You won&rsquo;t say a word&mdash;will you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course I won&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not to mother, I mean, most of all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Certainly not.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Squire Pemberton has been talking too loud for his own
good.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know that; he was in the store this forenoon, and Jeff
Davis himself is no bigger traitor than he is.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Some of the people are going to make him a call
to-night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What for?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you suppose? Can&rsquo;t you see through a
millstone, Tom, when there is a hole in it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what you mean.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You can come with us if you like, and then you will know
all about it,&rdquo; added John, mysteriously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But what are you going to do?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are going to make him hoist the American flag on his
house, or hang it out of his window.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, suppose he won&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then we&rsquo;ll hang him where the flag ought to be.
We&rsquo;ll pull the house down over his head.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m with you, Jack,&rdquo; replied Thomas, with
enthusiasm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We won&rsquo;t have a traitor in Pinchbrook. If we
can&rsquo;t cure him, we&rsquo;ll ride him on a rail out of the
town.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know as you and I ought to get into this
scrape,&rdquo; added Thomas, thoughtfully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why not?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You know the squire has a mortgage on our house, and he
may get ugly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let him, if he likes. I&rsquo;m not going to tolerate a
traitor because he has a mortgage on my father&rsquo;s house.
Besides, that is a fair business transaction; the squire gets his
interest.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mother is afraid of him, as she is of the evil
spirit.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Women are always timid,&rdquo; said John, sagely.</p>
<p>&ldquo;By George! there comes the very man himself!&rdquo;
exclaimed Thomas, as he discovered a horse and chaise slowly
approaching.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So it is; that old chaise looks rather the worse for the
wear. It looks as though it had been through the wars.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The vehicle did bear very evident marks of hard usage. One of
the shafts was broken, the dasher wrenched off, and the top stove
in. The horse was covered with mud, and limped badly from the
effects of his fall. The broken shaft and the harness were now
plentifully adorned with ropes and old straps. In fact, the
catastrophe had utterly ruined all claim which the chaise ever
might have had to be considered a &ldquo;hahnsome
kerridge.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;ll be fun nearer home, I reckon,&rdquo; said
John, as he obtained his first view of the sour visage of the
squire.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t help it,&rdquo; added Thomas.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Keep a stiff upper lip, Tom.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I intend to do so.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t say a word about to-night, Tom.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course not.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When the chaise had approached near enough to enable the squire
to recognize the author of his misfortunes, he stopped the horse,
and got out of the vehicle, with the whip in his hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, you young scoundrel, I will teach you to insult me
and my son, and destroy my property. Stay in the chaise, Fred, and
hold the horse,&rdquo; he added to his son.</p>
<p>But there was not much need of holding the horse now, for he was
too lame to run fast or far. Thomas and John came to a halt; and if
the squire had been a prudent man, he might have seen by the flash
of their eyes, that he was about to engage in an unsafe
operation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am going to horsewhip you within an inch of your life,
you villain, you!&rdquo; roared the squire, brandishing the
whip.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, you are not,&rdquo; replied Thomas, coolly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you drop the weight of that lash on my brother,
I&rsquo;ll smash your head,&rdquo; added John.</p>
<p>The squire paused, and glanced at the wiry form of the young
sailor. Better thoughts, or at least wiser ones, came to his
aid.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can bring you to your senses in another way,&rdquo;
said he, dropping his whip, and getting into the chaise again.
&ldquo;You will hear from me before the week is out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let him go; don&rsquo;t say a word, Tom,&rdquo; added
John.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He will prosecute me, I suppose he means by
that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let him prosecute and be hanged! I&rsquo;ll bet by
to-morrow morning he will think better of it. At any rate, he will
find out what the people of Pinchbrook think of him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The boys resumed their walk, and soon reached the store, where
they found the group of idlers, that always frequent shops in the
country, busily engaged in discussing the affair in which Thomas
had been the principal actor. As the boys entered, the hero of the
Pinchbrook Battle was saluted with a volley of applause, and his
conduct fully approved and commended, for a copperhead in that day
was an abomination to the people.</p>

<h2>Taming a Traitor.</h2>
<p class="returnTOC"><a href="#Contents">Return to Table of
Contents</a></p>
<p>With the exception of Squire Pemberton, Pinchbrook was a
thoroughly loyal town; and the people felt that it was a scandal
and a disgrace to have even a single traitor within its border. The
squire took no pains to conceal his treasonable sentiments, though
the whole town was in a blaze of patriotic excitement. On the
contrary, he had gone out of his way, and taken a great deal of
pains, to condemn the government and the people of the North.</p>
<p>Squire Pemberton was a wealthy man, and he had always been a
person of great influence in the place. He had occupied all the
principal official positions in town and county. He had come to
regard himself, as his townsmen were for the most part willing to
regard him, as the social and political oracle of the place. What
he thought in town meeting was generally the sense of his
fellow-citizens, and when he expressed himself in words, his word
was law.</p>
<p>When, on Sunday morning, with Fort Sumter in ruins, with the
national flag trodden under the feet of traitors, with the
government insulted and threatened, Squire Pemberton ventured to
speak in tones of condemnation of the free North, the people of
Pinchbrook listened coldly, at first, to the sayings of their
oracle; and when he began to abuse the loyal spirit of the North,
some ventured to dissent from him. The oracle was not in the habit
of having men dissent, and it made him angry. His treason became
more treasonable, his condemnation more bitter. Plain, honest men,
to whatever party they might have belonged, were disgusted with the
great man of Pinchbrook; and some of them ventured to express their
disapprobation of his course in very decided terms. Some were
disposed to be indulgent because the Squire had a sister in Georgia
who had married a planter. But there was not found a single person,
outside of his own family, who was mean enough to uphold him in his
treacherous denunciation of the government.</p>
<p>The squire was too self-sufficient and opinionated to be
influenced by the advice of friends or the warning of those who had
suddenly become his enemies. He had so often carried the town to
his own views, that, perhaps, he expected to manufacture a public
sentiment in Pinchbrook that would place the town on the side of
the rebels. All day Sunday, and all day Monday, he rode about the
Harbor preaching treason. He tried to convince the people that the
South had all the right, and the North all the wrong; but he had
never found them so obstinate and incredulous before.</p>
<p>Towards night one of the ministers ventured to suggest to him
that he was sowing the wind, and would reap the whirlwind. The good
man even hinted that he had roused a storm of indignation in the
town which he might find it difficult to allay.</p>
<p>The squire laughed at the minister, and told him he was not
afraid of any thing. He intended to speak his honest sentiments, as
every citizen had a right to do; and he would like to see any man,
or any body of men, who would dare to meddle with him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am afraid you will see them, Squire Pemberton,&rdquo;
added the minister.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let them come where they please and when they
please.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What will you do? What is your single arm against scores
of strong men?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing, perhaps, but I don&rsquo;t fear them. I am true
to my convictions; why need I fear?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think your convictions, as you call them, are deluding
you. Do you think Benedict Arnold&rsquo;s convictions, if he had
any, would have saved his neck from the halter?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you mean to compare me to Benedict Arnold,
sir?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I came to you, as a friend, to warn you of impending
danger; and, as your friend, I am compelled to say that I
don&rsquo;t see much difference between your position and that of
Benedict Arnold.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you mean to insult me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not at all, sir. I was only expressing my honest
conviction. Instead of placing yourself on the side of your
government, on the side of law and order, you are going about
Pinchbrook Harbor denouncing the legitimate government of your
country, and pleading the cause of rebels and traitors.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Am I not at liberty to say what I please of the
government?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In ordinary times, you are. Just now, the country is in a
state of war, and he who is not for the flag is against it. You may
criticize the government as its friend, but not as its foe. When
armed men conspire against the peace of the land, he who pleads
their cause is a traitor&mdash;nay, sir, don&rsquo;t be angry;
these are my convictions.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Political parsons have been the ruin of the
country,&rdquo; sneered the squire. &ldquo;That is my
conviction.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Squire Pemberton, I beg you not to be rash. If you must
cherish these pernicious views, I entreat you, keep them to
yourself. You may think what you please, but the utterance of
treason makes a traitor.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I shall proclaim my views from the housetop,&rdquo;
replied the squire, angrily, as he abruptly turned away from the
minister.</p>
<p>The squire continued obdurate to the last. Neither the
persuasions of his friends nor the threats of his enemies had any
effect in silencing his tongue; and as late as sundown on that day
of the Great Awakening he was pouring treachery and treason into
the ears of a neighbor who happened to pass his house. Half an hour
later in the day, there was a great gathering of men and boys at
the bridge on the outskirts of the village. They were singing Hail
Columbia and the Star-spangled Banner. Thomas and John Somers were
there.</p>
<p>Presently the assemblage began to move up the road which led to
Squire Pemberton&rsquo;s house, singing patriotic songs as they
marched. It was a multitude of persons for Pinchbrook; and no doubt
the obnoxious oracle thought so when he saw the sea of heads that
surrounded his dwelling. If this was a mob, it was certainly a very
orderly mob, for the crowd thus far had done nothing worse than to
sing the national airs.</p>
<p>The arrangements had all been made before the multitude started
from the place of rendezvous. Three gentlemen, the principal of
whom was Captain Barney, had been appointed a committee to wait
upon the squire, and politely request him to display the American
flag on his premises.</p>
<p>In the road, in front of the house, a large fire had been
kindled, which threw a broad, bright glare on the house and the
surrounding grounds. It was as light as day in the vicinity when
the committee walked up to the front door of the house and rang the
bell. The squire answered the summons himself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Squire Pemberton,&rdquo; said Captain Barney, &ldquo;your
fellow-citizens, about two hundred in number, have called upon you
with a simple and reasonable request.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is it?&rdquo; demanded the squire.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That you hoist the Stars and Stripes on your
house.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I won&rsquo;t do it!&rdquo; roared the victim, as he
slammed the door in the faces of the committee.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is insolence,&rdquo; said Captain Barney, quietly.
&ldquo;We will go in.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The captain led the way; but the door had been locked upon them.
The shoulders of three stout men pressed against it, and the bolt
yielded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you mean, you villains?&rdquo; thundered the
squire, as he confronted the committee in the entry.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You were so impolite as to close the door in our faces
before we had finished our story,&rdquo; replied the immovable old
sea captain.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How dare you break in my door?&rdquo; growled the
squire.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We shall do worse than that, squire, if you don&rsquo;t
treat us respectfully.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A man&rsquo;s house is his castle,&rdquo; added the
squire, a little more moderately.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s very good law, but there isn&rsquo;t a house
in Pinchbrook that is big enough or strong enough to shield a
traitor from the indignation of his fellow-citizens. We do not
purpose to harm you or your property, if you behave like a
reasonable man.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You shall suffer for this outrage,&rdquo; gasped the
squire, whose rage was increased by the cool and civil manner of
Captain Barney.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When you closed the door in my face, I had intimated that
your fellow-citizens wish you to display the national
flag.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I refuse to do it, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Consider, squire, what you say. The people have made up
their minds not to tolerate a traitor within the corporate limits
of the town of Pinchbrook.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am no traitor.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is precisely what we wish you to demonstrate to your
fellow-citizens assembled outside to witness an exhibition of your
patriotism.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will not do it on compulsion.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then, sir, we shall be obliged to resort to disagreeable
measures.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you mean by that, sir?&rdquo; asked the squire,
who was evidently alarmed by the threat. &ldquo;Do you mean to
proceed to violence?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We do, Squire Pemberton,&rdquo; answered Captain Barney,
decidedly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;O my country!&rdquo; sighed the victim, &ldquo;has it
come to this? The laws will no longer protect her
citizens.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s very fine, sir. Do you expect the laws to
protect you while you are aiding and abetting those who are trying
to destroy them? Is there any law to protect a traitor in his
treason? But we waste time, Squire Pemberton. Will you display the
American flag?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Suppose I refuse?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We will pull your house down over your head. We will give
you a coat of tar and feathers, and remove you beyond the limits of
the town. If you ever come back, we will hang you to the nearest
tree.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good Heaven! Is it possible that my fellow-citizens are
assassins&mdash;incendiaries!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your answer, squire.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;For mercy&rsquo;s sake, husband, do what they ask,&rdquo;
interposed his wife, who had been an anxious listener in the
adjoining room.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I must do it,&rdquo; groaned the squire, speaking the
truth almost for the first time in forty-eight hours. &ldquo;Alas!
where is our boasted liberty of speech!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fudge! squire,&rdquo; replied Captain Barney,
contemptuously. &ldquo;If your friend Jeff Davis should come to
Massachusetts to-morrow, to preach a crusade against the North, and
to raise an army to destroy the free institutions of the country, I
suppose you think it would be an outrage upon free speech to put
him down. We don&rsquo;t think so. Up with the flag,
squire.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fred, you may hang the flag out at the front window up
stairs,&rdquo; said the squire to his son.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right, squire. Now a few words more, and we bid you
good night. You may <em>think</em> what you please, but if you
utter another word of treason in Pinchbrook during the term of your
natural life, the party outside will carry out the rest of the
programme.&rdquo;</p>
<p>By this time Fred Pemberton had fastened the flag to one of his
mother&rsquo;s clothes poles, and suspended it out of the window
over the porch. It was hailed with three tremendous cheers by the
multitude who were in waiting to discipline the squire, and
exorcise the evil spirit of treason and secession.</p>
<p>The work of the evening was finished, not wholly to the
satisfaction, perhaps, of a portion of the younger members of the
assemblage, who would gladly have joined in the work of pillage and
destruction, but much to the gratification of the older and
steadier portion of the crowd, who were averse to violent
proceedings.</p>
<h3><a id="Ch_4" name="Ch_4">Chapter IV.</a></h3>
<h2>The Committee come out, and Tom goes in.</h2>
<p class="returnTOC"><a href="#Contents">Return to Table of
Contents</a></p>
<p>While the committee which the loyal citizens of Pinchbrook had
appointed to conduct their case with Squire Pemberton were in the
house, engaged in bringing the traitor to terms, the younger
members of the assemblage were very impatient to know how matters
were progressing. Thomas Somers was particularly anxious to have
the affair brought to a crisis. In vain he and a few other of the
young loyalists attempted to obtain a view of the interior of the
house, where the exciting interview was in progress.</p>
<p>Captain Barney, on shore as well as at sea, was a thorough
disciplinarian. Of course, he was aware that his proceedings were
technically illegal; that in forcing himself into the house of the
squire he was breaking the law of the land; but it seemed to him to
be one of those cases where prompt action was necessary, and the
law was too tardy to be of any service. He was, however, determined
that the business should be done with as little violence as
possible, and he had instructed the citizens at the bridge to do no
needless injury to the property or the feelings of the squire or
his family.</p>
<p>When he entered the house, he had stationed three men at the
door to prevent any of the people from following him. He had also
directed them not to enter the yard or grounds of the house until
he gave the signal. These directions proved a great hardship to the
boys in the crowd, and they were completely disgusted when they saw
the flag thrown loose from the front window.</p>
<p>The mansion of Squire Pemberton was an old-fashioned dwelling,
about a hundred feet from the road. In front of it was a green
lawn, adorned with several large buttonwood trees. There was no
fence to enclose what was called the front yard. The crowd was
assembled on this lawn, and agreeably to the directions of the
leader, or chairman of the committee, none of them passed into the
yard in the rear and at the end of the house, which was separated
from the lawn by a picket fence.</p>
<p>Boys are instinctively curious to know what is going on, and the
&ldquo;living room&rdquo; of the squire, in which the exciting
conversation was taking place, was in the rear of the house. The
windows on the front were dark and uncommunicative. The boys were
restless and impatient; if there was to be any fun, they wanted to
see it. Thomas was as impatient as his fellows, and being more
enterprising than the others, he determined, while obeying the
instructions of Captain Barney in the spirit, to disobey them in
the letter.</p>
<p>He had been a sufferer to the extent of two great wales on the
calves of his legs by the treason of the squire, and no doubt he
thought he ought to be regarded as an exception to those who were
called on to observe the instructions of the chairman of the
committee. Leaving the group of inquiring minds near the front door
of the house, he walked down the driveway till he came to a rail
fence, through which he crawled, and entered the field adjoining
the garden of the squire. His fellow-citizens, men and boys, were
too intently watching the house to heed him, and no one noticed his
enterprising movement.</p>
<p>From the field, he entered the garden, and made his way to the
rear of the house. But even here, he was doomed to disappointment,
for Mrs. Pemberton had drawn her curtains. Our hero was not,
however, to be utterly defeated, and as the curtains had not been
fitted by an accomplished upholsterer, there were openings on
either side, through which he might command a full view of the
interior of the room.</p>
<p>Thomas proceeded slowly and cautiously to obtain a position
which would enable him to gratify his curiosity, and witness the
humiliation of the haughty squire. Beneath the window which, he had
chosen to look through, there was a cellar door, from which a pile
of seaweed, placed upon it to keep the frost out of the cellar, had
just been removed. The adventurous inquirer crept up the slippery
boards, and gained the coveted position. He could not only see the
committee and the squire, but he could hear all they said. He was
perfectly delighted with the manner in which the captain put the
question to the squire; and when the latter ordered Fred to hang
out the flag, he was a little disposed to imitate the masculine
occupants of the hen-house, a short distance from his perch; but
Tom, as we have before intimated, had a very tolerable idea of the
principles of strategy, and had the self-possession to hold his
tongue, and permit the triumphant scene within to pass without a
crow or a cheer.</p>
<p>The battle had been fought and the victory won; and though Tom
felt that he was one of the victors, he deemed it prudent, for
strategical reasons, to commence a retreat. The cellar doors, as we
have before hinted, were very slippery, having been thoroughly
soaked with moisture while covered with the seaweed. When the hero
of this unauthorized reconnoissance wheeled about to commence his
retreat, his feet incontinently slipped up upon the inclined
surface of the doors, and he came down heavily upon the rotten
boards. This, in itself, would have been but an inconsiderable
disaster, and he might still have withdrawn from the inconvenient
locality, if circumstances had not conspired against him, as
circumstances sometimes will, when they ought to be conciliatory
and accommodating. The force with which Tom fell upon the decayed
boards was too much for them, and the unlucky adventurer became
another victim to the treachery of rotten wood, which has hurled so
many thousands from time into eternity.</p>
<p>But Tom was not hurled so far as that on the present occasion,
though for all practical purposes, for the succeeding half hour, he
might as well have been a hundred fathoms under water, or beneath
the wreck of a twenty-ton locomotive at the bottom of the river.
That cellar door was a bad place to fall through, which may be
accounted for on the supposition that it was not made to fall
through. In his downward progress, Tom had unluckily struck his
head against the side of the house; and when he landed at the
bottom of the stairs, he was utterly oblivious to all distinctions
between treason and loyalty. Tom was not killed, I need not inform
the ingenious reader, or this would otherwise have been the last
chapter of the story; but the poor fellow did not know whether he
was dead or alive.</p>
<p>In fact, he had not sense enough left to consider the question
at all; for there he lay, in the gloom of the traitor&rsquo;s dark
cellar, silent and motionless&mdash;a solemn warning to all our
young readers of the folly and wickedness of indulging an illegal
and sinful curiosity. It may seem cruel and inhuman in us to
forsake poor Tom in this sad plight; but we must, nevertheless, go
up stairs, in order that the sufferer may be duly and properly
relieved in due and proper season.</p>
<p>When the committee of three, appointed by the indignant
loyalists of Pinchbrook, had completed their mission in the house
of the squire, like sensible men they proposed to leave; and they
so expressed themselves, through their spokesman, to the unwilling
host. They put their hats on, and moved into the front entry,
whither they were followed by the discomfited traitor. They had
scarcely left the room before a tremendous crash greeted the ears
of that portion of the family which remained in the apartment. This
was the precise moment at which poor Tom Somers found himself on
the bottom of the cellar; or, to be entirely accurate, when he lost
himself on the bottom of the cellar.</p>
<p>Mrs. Pemberton heard the crash, and she very naturally concluded
that the hour of retribution had actually come; that the terrible
mob had commenced the work of destruction. To her
&ldquo;fear-amazed&rdquo; mind it seemed as though the whole side
of the house had fallen in, and, for a moment, she confidently
expected the chimneys would presently go by the board, and the roof
come thundering down upon the devoted heads of her outraged family.
Perhaps, at that terrible moment, she wished her husband had been
like other women&rsquo;s husbands, a true and loyal man, cheering
the old flag, and hurling harmless anathemas at the graceless
rebels.</p>
<p>But the chimney did not go by the board, nor the roof come
thundering down upon her head. There was not even a sound of
destruction to be heard, and the sides of the house seemed to be
firm and decided in their intention to maintain their perpendicular
position. A few minutes later, when the committee announced to the
multitude the success of their undertaking, and Fred had displayed
the flag from the window, peal upon peal of stunning huzzas saluted
her ears, and the awful peril of the preceding moments appeared to
be averted. The squire, having closed and barricaded the broken
door as well as he could, returned to the room, with curses deep
and bitter upon his lips. He was not in the habit of swearing, but
the magnitude of the occasion seemed to justify the innovation, and
he swore hugely, roundly, awfully. He paced the room, ground his
teeth, and stamped upon the floor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Father, did you hear that terrible racket just
now?&rdquo; asked Mrs. Pemberton. &ldquo;I thought the side of the
house had fallen in.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What racket?&rdquo; demanded the squire, pausing in his
excited walk.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am sure they have broken something.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It sounded as though it was down cellar,&rdquo; added
Susan, the daughter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What was it?&rdquo; asked the father.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know. It sounded like breaking boards. Do
go down cellar, and find out what it was.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The scoundrels!&rdquo; roared the squire, as he rushed up
and down the room again with the fury of a madman.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll teach them to break into my house!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Be calm, father,&rdquo; interposed Mrs. Pemberton, who,
like most New England mothers, called her husband by the title
which belonged exclusively to the children.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Calm? How can I be calm? Don&rsquo;t you hear the
ruffians shout and yell?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They are only cheering the flag.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The squire muttered a malediction upon the flag, which would
probably have procured for him a coat of tar and feathers, if the
mob had heard it. Mrs. Pemberton was silent, for she had never seen
her husband so moved before. She permitted him to pace the room in
his frenzy till his anger had, in some measure, subsided.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wish you would go down cellar and find out what that
noise was,&rdquo; said Mrs. Pemberton, as soon as she dared to
speak again. &ldquo;Perhaps some of them are down there now. Who
knows but they will set the house afire.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Squire Pemberton was startled by this suggestion, and, seizing
the lamp, he rushed down cellar to prevent so dire a calamity.</p>

<h2>The Attic Chamber.</h2>
<p class="returnTOC"><a href="#Contents">Return to Table of
Contents</a></p>
<p>Squire Pemberton rushed down cellar. He was very much excited,
and forgot that he had been troubled with the rheumatism during the
preceding winter. When he opened the cellar door, he was
considerably relieved to find that no brilliant light saluted his
expectant gaze. It was as cold and dark in the cellar as it had
been when he sorted over the last of his Warren Russets, a few days
before.</p>
<p>It was certain, therefore, that the house was not on fire; and,
invigorated by this thought, he descended the stairs. A strong
current of fresh, cold air extinguished the light he carried. As
this was contrary to his usual experience when he went down cellar
in the evening after an apple or a mug of cider, it assured him
that there was a screw loose somewhere. Returning to the room
above, he procured a lantern, and proceeded to the cellar again to
renew his investigations.</p>
<p>The squire felt the cold blast of the April air, and immediately
made his way to the cellar door, holding the lantern up as high as
his head, to ascertain the nature of the mischief which the
fanatical abolitionists had perpetrated. He saw that the cellar
door was broken through. The rotten boards lay upon the steps, and
with another malediction upon the mob, he placed the lantern upon a
barrel, and proceeded to repair the damage. As he stepped forward,
he stumbled against the body of the enterprising hero of this
volume, who lay as calm and still as a sleeping child.</p>
<p>The squire started back, not a little alarmed at the sight of
the motionless body. He felt as though a terrible retribution had
fallen upon somebody, who had been killed in the act of attempting
to destroy his property. Seizing his lantern, he retreated to the
cellar stairs by which he had descended, and stood there for a
moment, his tongue paralyzed, and his knees smiting each other, in
the agony of terror.</p>
<p>We do not know what he was afraid of, but we suppose that
instinctive dread which some people manifest in the presence of
death, had completely overcome him. Certainly there was nothing to
be afraid of, for a dead man is not half so likely to do a person
an injury as a living one. But in a few minutes Squire Pemberton in
some measure recovered his self-possession.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is a dead man down here!&rdquo; he called up the
staircase, in quaking tones.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mercy on us!&rdquo; exclaimed Mrs. Pemberton. &ldquo;Who
is he?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; replied the squire.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look and see who it is, father,&rdquo; added Mrs.
Pemberton. &ldquo;Perhaps he isn&rsquo;t dead.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stone dead,&rdquo; persisted the squire. &ldquo;He fell
into the cellar and broke his neck.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go and see who it is&mdash;will you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, you come down and hold the light,&rdquo; said the
squire, who was not quite willing to say that he was scared out of
his wits.</p>
<p>Mrs. Pemberton descended the stairs, followed by Susan and Fred,
who had just returned from the front window, where he had exhibited
the flag, which the crowd outside were still cheering.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who can it be?&rdquo; continued the old lady, as she
slowly and cautiously walked forward to the scene of the
catastrophe.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; replied the squire, in whom
the presence of his family had spurred up a semblance of courage;
for if a man ever is brave, it is in the presence of his wife and
children. &ldquo;If it is one of the ruffians who came here to
destroy my house, I am glad he has lost his life in the attempt. It
is a righteous retribution upon him for his wickedness.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Pemberton took the lantern, and the squire, still excited
and terrified, bent over the prostrate form of the young marauder.
The victim lay upon his face, and the squire had to turn him over
to obtain a view of his countenance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I declare it is one of the Somers boys!&rdquo; exclaimed
Mrs. Pemberton, as her husband brought the face of Thomas to her
view.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The young villain!&rdquo; ejaculated the squire.
&ldquo;It is lucky he was killed, or the house would have been in
flames before this time. He is a desperate young
scoundrel.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But he isn&rsquo;t dead, father!&rdquo; said Mrs.
Pemberton, as she knelt upon the cold ground, and felt the pulse of
the insensible boy. &ldquo;He is only stunned.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am sorry for it. If it had killed him, it would have
served him right,&rdquo; added the squire, who had suddenly become
as bold as a lion&mdash;as bold as two lions.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come, father, let&rsquo;s carry him up stairs, and put
him to bed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you think I am going to do anything for this young
scoundrel!&rdquo; exclaimed the squire, indignantly. &ldquo;Why, he
stoned Fred and me to-day, and stoned the horse, and made him run
away and break the chaise all to pieces.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But we mustn&rsquo;t leave him here in this situation. He
may die.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let him die.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But what will folks say?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The more humane wife evidently understood the weak point of the
squire, for nothing but slavery and the Southern Confederacy could
have induced him to set at defiance the public sentiment of
Pinchbrook.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, carry him up stairs then; but he never will get out
of my house till he has been severely punished for his
crimes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The squire and Fred took hold of the senseless form of poor Tom,
and carried it up stairs, where it was placed upon the sofa in the
sitting room. Mrs. Pemberton had the reputation of being &ldquo;an
excellent hand in sickness,&rdquo; and she immediately applied
herself to the duty of restoring the sufferer to consciousness.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you think you had better go after the doctor,
father?&rdquo; asked the good woman. &ldquo;Some of his bones may
be broken, or he may be injured inwardly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I shall not go for any doctor,&rdquo; snarled the squire.
&ldquo;Do you think I will trust myself out doors while that
howling mob is hanging round the house?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fred can go,&rdquo; suggested Susan.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He can, but he shall not,&rdquo; growled the squire,
throwing himself into his arm chair in the corner, with an
appearance of indifference and unconcern, which were far from
representing the actual state of his mind.</p>
<p>Mrs. Pemberton said no more, but she and Susan went to work upon
the sufferer with camphor and hartshorn in good earnest, and in a
short time they had the satisfaction of seeing him open his eyes.
They continued the treatment for some time longer, with the most
satisfactory result, till Tom astonished them by jumping off the
sofa, and standing up in the middle of the room. He rubbed his
forehead, hunched up his left shoulder, and felt of his shins.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you hurt, Thomas?&rdquo; asked Mrs. Pemberton, with
more of tenderness in her tones than the squire deemed proper for
the occasion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, marm, I guess not,&rdquo; replied Tom. &ldquo;My
shoulder feels a little stiff, and I think I barked one of my
shins; but I shall be as good as new by to-morrow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But there was an ugly bump on the side of his head, which he had
not yet discovered, but which Susan pointed out to him. He
acknowledged the bump, but declared it was only a little sore and
would be all right by the next day.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I feel pretty well,&rdquo; continued Tom, &ldquo;and I
guess I&rsquo;ll go home now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think you won&rsquo;t, young man,&rdquo; interposed
Squire Pemberton.</p>
<p>Tom looked at him, and for the first time since he had come to
himself, he remembered in what manner he had received his injuries.
He immediately came to the conclusion that he had got into a bad
scrape. He was in the house of, and in the presence of, his great
enemy. The events of the day passed in rapid succession through his
mind, and he could not help thinking that he was destined to be the
first victim in Pinchbrook to the war spirit which had just been
awakened all over the country.</p>
<p>The squire thought he would not go home, which was as much as to
say he would not let him go home. Tom&rsquo;s wits were a little
confused, after the hard knock he had received upon the head, and
all he could do was to stand and look at the oracle of Pinchbrook,
and wait for further developments.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Young man,&rdquo; said the squire, sternly, and in tones
that were intended to make a deep impression upon the mind of the
young man, &ldquo;your time has come.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The squire paused, and looked at the culprit to ascertain the
effect of the startling announcement; but Tom seemed to be
perfectly cool, and was not annihilated by the suggestive remark of
the great man of Pinchbrook.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have become a midnight marauder,&rdquo; added the
squire, poetically.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t seven o&rsquo;clock yet,&rdquo; said Tom
pointing to the great wooden clock in the corner of the room.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You joined a mob to pillage and destroy the property of a
peaceable citizen. You broke in&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, sir; the cellar door broke in,&rdquo; interposed the
culprit.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You broke into my house to set it afire!&rdquo; continued
the squire, in a rage.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, sir, I did not. I only went round there to see the
fun,&rdquo; replied Tom, pointing to the rear of the house;
&ldquo;and the cellar door broke down and let me in. I did not mean
to do you or your house any harm; and I didn&rsquo;t do any, except
breaking the cellar door, and I will have that mended.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t tell me, you young villain! You meant to burn
my house.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I didn&rsquo;t mean any thing of the kind,&rdquo;
replied Tom, stoutly. &ldquo;I was going off when the door broke
down. The boards were rotten, and I should think a man like you
ought to have better cellar doors than those are.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The squire didn&rsquo;t relish this criticism, especially from
the source whence it came. There was a want of humility on the part
of the culprit which the magnate of Pinchbrook thought would be
exceedingly becoming in a young man in his situation. The absence
of it made him more angry than before. He stormed and hurled
denunciations at the offender; he rehearsed the mischief he had
done during the day, and alluded in strong terms to that which he
intended to perpetrate in the &ldquo;dead watches of the
night&rdquo;&mdash;which was the poetical rendering of half-past
six in the evening; for the squire was fond of effective
phrases.</p>
<p>Tom ventured to hint that a man who would not stand by his
country when her flag was insulted and &ldquo;trailed in the
dust&rdquo;&mdash;Tom had read the daily papers&mdash;ought to be
brought to his senses by such expedients as his fellow-citizens
might suggest. Of course this remark only increased the
squire&rsquo;s wrath, and he proceeded to pronounce sentence upon
the unlucky youth, which was that he should be taken to the
finished room in the attic, and confined there under bolts and bars
till the inquisitor should further declare and execute his
intentions.</p>
<p>Mrs. Pemberton and Susan remonstrated against this sentence,
prudently suggesting the consequences which might result from
detaining the boy. But the squire declared he should not go till he
had at least horsewhipped him; and if there was any justice left in
the land, he would send him to the county jail in the morning.</p>
<p>Tom wanted to resist the execution of his sentence, but he was
still weak from the effects of his fall, and he could not expect to
vanquish both the squire and his son; so, with an earnest protest,
he permitted himself to be led to the attic chamber. The squire
thrust him into the room, and after carefully securing the door,
left our hero to meditate upon the reverse of fortune which had
overtaken him.</p>

<h2>The Way is Prepared.</h2>
<p class="returnTOC"><a href="#Contents">Return to Table of
Contents</a></p>
<p>&ldquo;Where do you suppose Thomas is?&rdquo; said Mrs. Somers,
as she glanced at the clock, which indicated half-past nine.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; replied John. &ldquo;He
can&rsquo;t be a great ways off. I saw him in front of the
squire&rsquo;s house when the committee went in.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The boy&rsquo;s gone down to the Harbor again with the
rest of the folks, talking about the war,&rdquo; added
gran&rsquo;ther Greene, as he rose from his chair, and hobbled into
his chamber adjoining the kitchen.</p>
<p>At ten o&rsquo;clock, the mother began to be a little uneasy;
and at eleven, even John had some fears that all was not well with
his brother. Neither of them was able to suggest anything that
could possibly have happened to the absentee. There had been no
battle fought, and so nobody could have been killed. There had been
no violence used in the transactions of the evening further than
breaking in the front door of Squire Pemberton, so that it was not
easy to believe that any accident had happened to him.</p>
<p>John had given a glowing account of the proceedings at the house
of the squire and the family had been much interested and excited
by the stirring narrative. His mother was perfectly satisfied, as
no one had been injured, and hoped the great man of Pinchbrook
would be brought to his senses. All these topics had been fully
discussed during the evening. John had informed his mother that
Captain Benson, who had formerly commanded the Pinchbrook Riflemen,
intended to raise a company for the war. He mentioned the names of
half a dozen young men who had expressed their desire to join. The
family had suggested that this and that man would go, and thus the
long evening passed away.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see what has become of Thomas,&rdquo; said
Mrs. Somers, when the clock struck eleven, as she rose from her
chair and looked out of the window.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I don&rsquo;t see, either,&rdquo; replied John.
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe there is anything going on at this
time of night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope nothing has happened to him,&rdquo; continued the
anxious mother, as she went to the door and looked out, hoping,
perhaps, to discover him in the gloom of the night, or to hear his
familiar step.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What could have happened to him?&rdquo; asked John, who
did not believe his brother was fool enough to fall overboard, or
permit any serious accident to happen to him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know. I can&rsquo;t see what has got the
boy. He always comes home before nine o&rsquo;clock. Have you heard
him say anything that will give you an idea where he is?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He hasn&rsquo;t said anything to me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Try, and see if you can&rsquo;t think of
something,&rdquo; persisted the anxious mother.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He hasn&rsquo;t talked of anything but the war since
yesterday morning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What did he say?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know, now,&rdquo; answered John, musing.
&ldquo;He said he should like to join the army, and go down and
fight the rebels.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Somers had heard as much from him, but she had given no
particular attention to his remarks on this subject, for they
seemed wild and visionary. John&rsquo;s words, under the present
circumstances, appeared to be full of importance; and taking her
stocking, she seated herself before the stove, and resumed her
knitting. She was silent now, for her heart was heavy with the
premonitions of impending trouble.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will take a walk down to the Harbor, mother, and see if
I can find anything of him. There may be something going on there
that I don&rsquo;t know about. He may be at the store, talking
about the war with Captain Barney and the rest of the
folks.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Somers offered no objection to this plan, and John put on
his cap, and left the house. The poor mother brooded upon her
trouble for another hour, and with every new moment, the trouble
seemed more real. The clock struck twelve before John returned; and
more than once during his absence, as she plied her needles, she
had wiped away a tear that hung among the furrows of her care-worn
cheek. She had been thinking of her husband, as well as of her son.
He was, or soon would be, in the midst of the traitors, and she
trembled for him. Uncle Wyman was a secessionist; and, beyond this,
she had not much confidence in his integrity, and if Captain Somers
came home at all, his property would all be swept away, and he
would be a beggar.</p>
<p>The events of that day were not calculated to conciliate Squire
Pemberton towards them, and the farm and the cottage would pass
away from them. All these things had been considered and
reconsidered by the devoted mother. Poverty and want seemed to
stare her in the face; and to add to all these troubles, Thomas did
not come home, and, as fond mothers will, she anticipated the
worst.</p>
<p>John entered the kitchen, and carelessly flung his cap upon the
table. Mrs. Somers looked at him, and waited patiently to hear any
intelligence he might bring. But John threw himself into a chair,
looking more gloomy than before he left the house. He did not
speak, and therefore he had no good news to tell.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You didn&rsquo;t see anything of him&mdash;did
you?&rdquo; asked Mrs. Somers; but it was a useless question, for
she had already interpreted the meaning of his downcast looks.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, mother; there isn&rsquo;t a man, woman, or child
stirring in the village; and I didn&rsquo;t see a light in a single
house.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you suppose can have become of him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure I don&rsquo;t know. Tom is old enough and
smart enough to take care of himself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s very strange.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So it is. I haven&rsquo;t any idea what has become of
him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you look around Squire Pemberton&rsquo;s house, where
he was seen last?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I looked about on both sides of the road, going and
coming from the Harbor. I whistled all the way, and if he had been
any where round, he would have whistled back, as he always
does.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you <em>suppose</em> has become of him?&rdquo;
demanded the poor mother, worried beyond expression at the
mysterious disappearance of her son.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t tell, mother.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you think we had better call up the
neighbors, and have something done about it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; replied John, hardly less
anxious than his mother.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t suppose they would be able to find him if
we did,&rdquo; added Mrs. Somers, wiping away the tears from her
face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t think anything has happened to him, mother.
If he had been on the water, or anything of that kind, I should
feel worse about it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If I only knew where he was, I shouldn&rsquo;t feel so
bad about it,&rdquo; said she; and her position, certainly, was a
reasonable one.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter, sister?&rdquo; called
gran&rsquo;ther Greene, from his chamber. &ldquo;Hasn&rsquo;t that
boy got home yet?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, he hasn&rsquo;t come yet, and I am worried to death
about him,&rdquo; replied Mrs. Somers, opening the door of her
brother&rsquo;s room.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What o&rsquo;clock is it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;After twelve. Thomas never stayed out so late in his life
before. What do you suppose has become of him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Law sake! I haven&rsquo;t the leastest idea,&rdquo;
answered the old man. &ldquo;Thomas is a smart boy, and knows
enough to keep out of trouble.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what I say,&rdquo; added John, who had
unlimited confidence in his brother&rsquo;s ability to take care of
himself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you what <em>I</em> think, John,&rdquo;
said Mrs. Somers, throwing herself into her chair with an air of
desperation.</p>
<p>But she did not tell John what she thought: on the contrary, she
sat rocking herself in silence, as though her thought was too big
and too momentous for utterance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, what do you think, mother?&rdquo; asked John, when
he had waited a reasonable time for her to express her opinion on
the exciting topic.</p>
<p>Mrs. Somers rocked herself more violently than before, and made
no reply.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What were you going to say?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think the boy has gone off to Boston, and gone into the
army,&rdquo; replied she, desperately, as though she had fully made
up her mind to commit herself to this belief.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you think so, mother?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I feel almost sure of it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think so, mother. Tom wouldn&rsquo;t have
gone off without saying something to me about it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If he wouldn&rsquo;t say it to me, he wouldn&rsquo;t be
likely to say it to you, John. It don&rsquo;t look a bit like
Thomas to go off and leave his mother in this way,&rdquo; moaned
the poor woman, wiping away a deluge of tears that now poured from
her eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe he has done any such thing,
mother,&rdquo; protested John.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I feel almost certain about it, now. If the boy wanted to
go, and couldn&rsquo;t stay at home, he ought to have told me
so.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He did say he wanted to go.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t think he really meant it. I want my boys
to love their country, and be ready to fight for it. Much as I
should hate to part with them, if they are needed, they may go; but
I don&rsquo;t like to have them run away and leave me in this mean
way. I shouldn&rsquo;t feel half so bad if I knew Thomas was in the
army now, as I do to think he ran away from home, just as though he
had done some mean thing. I am willing he should go, and he
wouldn&rsquo;t be a son of mine if he wasn&rsquo;t ready to go and
fight for his country, and die for her too, if there was any need
of it. I didn&rsquo;t think Thomas would serve me in this
way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe he has.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know he&rsquo;s gone. I like his spunk, but if he had
only come to me and said he <em>must</em> go, I wouldn&rsquo;t have
said a word; but to go off without bidding us good
by&mdash;it&rsquo;s too bad, and I didn&rsquo;t think Thomas would
do such a thing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Somers rose from her chair, and paced the room in the
highest state of agitation and excitement. The rockers were not
adequate to the duty required of them, and nothing less than the
whole floor of the kitchen was sufficient for the proper venting of
her emotion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you mean to say, mother, that you would have given him
leave to go, even if he had teased you for a month?&rdquo; asked
John.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Certainly I should,&rdquo; replied his mother, stopping
short in the middle of the floor. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m ready and
willing to have my boys fight for their country, but I don&rsquo;t
want them to sneak off as though they had been robbing a hen-roost,
and without even saying good by to me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If Tom were here, do you mean to say you would let him
go?&rdquo; demanded John, earnestly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Certainly I do; I mean so. But I don&rsquo;t think there
is any need of boys like him going, when there are men enough to do
the fighting.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You told Tom he shouldn&rsquo;t go.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I didn&rsquo;t think he really meant it. If he
had&mdash;What&rsquo;s that, John?&rdquo; asked she, suddenly, as a
noise at the window attracted her attention.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Only the cat, mother.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If Thomas or you had asked me in earnest, and there was
need of your going, I wouldn&rsquo;t have kept either of you at
home. I would go to the poorhouse first. My father and my brother
both fought for their country, and my sons shall when their country
wants them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then you are willing Tom should go?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am, but not to have him sneak off like a
sheep-stealer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Three cheers for you, mother!&rdquo; shouted Thomas, as
he threw up the window at which he had been standing for some ten
minutes listening to this interesting conversation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where have you been, Thomas?&rdquo; exclaimed the
delighted mother.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Open the door, Jack, and let me in, and I will tell you
all about it,&rdquo; replied the absentee.</p>

<h2>A Midnight Adventure.</h2>
<p class="returnTOC"><a href="#Contents">Return to Table of
Contents</a></p>
<p>Tom Somers was an enterprising young man, as our readers have
already discovered; and when the door of the finished room in the
attic of Squire Pemberton&rsquo;s house was fastened upon him, he
was not at all disposed to submit to the fate which appeared to be
in store for him. The idea of becoming a victim to the
squire&rsquo;s malice was not to be entertained, and he threw
himself upon the bed to devise some means by which he might make
his escape.</p>
<p>The prospect was not encouraging, for there was only one window
in the chamber, and the distance to the ground was suggestive of
broken limbs, if not of a broken neck. Tom had read the Life of
Baron Trenck, and of Stephen Burroughs, but the experience of
neither of these worthies seemed to be available on the present
occasion.</p>
<p>As the family had not yet retired, it would not be safe to
commence operations for some hours. The stale, commonplace method
of tying the sheets and blankets together, and thus forming a rope
by which he could descend to the ground, occurred to him; but he
had not much confidence in the project. He lay quietly on the bed
till he heard the clocks on the churches at the Harbor strike
twelve. It was time then, if ever, for the family to be asleep, and
he decided to attempt an escape by another means which had been
suggested to him. If it failed, he could then resort to the
old-fashioned way of going down on the rope made of sheets and
blankets.</p>
<p>The apartment in which Tom was confined was not what people in
the country call an &ldquo;upright chamber.&rdquo; The sides of the
room were about four feet in height; and a section of the apartment
would have formed one half of an irregular octagon. In each side of
the chamber there was a small door, opening into the space near the
eaves of the house, which was used to store old trunks, old boxes,
the disused spinning-wheel, and other lumber of this description.
Tom had been in the attic before, and he remembered these doors,
through one of which he now proposed to make his escape.</p>
<p>When the clock struck twelve, he cautiously rose from the bed,
and pulled off his boots, which a proper respect for his host or
the bed had not prompted him to do before. The house was old, and
the floors had a tendency to creak beneath his tread. With the
utmost care, he crawled on his hands and knees to one of the doors
of the lumber hole, which he succeeded in opening without much
noise.</p>
<p>Making his way in among the old boxes, trunks, and
spinning-wheels, he was fully embarked in his difficult venture.
The dust which he stirred up in his progress produced an almost
irresistible desire to sneeze, which Lord Dundreary might have been
happy to indulge, but which might have been fatal to the execution
of Tom Somers&rsquo;s purpose. He rubbed his nose, and held his
handkerchief over the intractable member, and succeeded in
overcoming its dangerous tendency. His movements were necessarily
very slow, for he was in constant dread lest some antiquated relic
of the past should tumble over, and thus disturb the slumbers of
the family who occupied the chambers below.</p>
<p>But in spite of the perils and difficulties that environed his
path, there was something exciting and exhilarating in the
undertaking. It was a real adventure, and, as such, Tom enjoyed it.
As he worked his way through the labyrinth of antiquities, he could
not but picture to himself the surprise and chagrin of Squire
Pemberton, when he should come up to the attic chamber to wreak his
vengeance upon him. He could see the magnate of Pinchbrook start,
compress his lips and clinch his fists, when he found the bird had
flown.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Better not crow till I get out of the woods,&rdquo; said
he to himself, while his imagination was still busy upon the
agreeable picture.</p>
<p>After a series of trials and difficulties which our space does
not permit us to describe in full, Tom emerged from the repository
of antiquities, and stood in the open space in front of the
finished chamber. With one boot in each hand, he felt his way to
the stairs, and descended to the entry over the front door. All
obstacles now seemed to be overcome, for he had nothing to do but
go down stairs and walk out.</p>
<p>It often happens, amid the uncertainties of this unstable world,
that we encounter the greatest trials and difficulties precisely
where we expect to find none. As Tom walked along the entry, with
one hand on the rail that protected the staircase to guide him, he
struck his foot against the pole upon which Fred Pemberton had
suspended the flag out of the window. It was very careless of the
squire, when he took the flag in, to leave the stick in that unsafe
position, for one of his own family might have stumbled against it,
and broken a leg or an arm, or possibly a neck; and if it might
have been a &ldquo;cause of offence&rdquo; to one of the
Pembertons, it certainly laid a grievous burden upon the shoulders
of poor Tom Somers.</p>
<p>When the pole fell, it made a tremendous racket, as all poles
will when they fall just at the moment when they ought to stand up,
and be decent and orderly. This catastrophe had the effect to
quicken the steps of the young man. He reached the stairs, and had
commenced a rapid descent, when the door of the squire&rsquo;s
room, which was on the lower floor, opened, and Tom found himself
flanked in that direction.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who&rsquo;s there? What&rsquo;s that?&rdquo; demanded the
squire, in hurried, nervous tones.</p>
<p>Tom was so impolite as to make no reply to these pressing
interrogatories, but quickly retreated in the direction from which
he had come.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wife, light the lamp, quick,&rdquo; said the squire, in
the hall below.</p>
<p>Just then a door opened on the other side of the entry where Tom
stood, and he caught a faint glimpse of a figure robed in white.
Though it was the solemn hour of midnight, and Tom, I am sorry to
say, had read the Three Spaniards, and Mysteries of Udolpho, he
rejected the suggestion that the &ldquo;sheeted form&rdquo; might
be a ghost.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who&rsquo;s there?&rdquo; called the squire again.</p>
<p>A romantic little scream from the figure in white assured Tom
that Miss Susan was the enemy immediately on his front. Then he
caught the glimmer of the light below, which Mrs. Pemberton had
procured, and the race seemed to be up. Concealment was no longer
practicable, and he seized upon the happy suggestion that the
window opening upon the portico over the front door was available
as a means of egress.</p>
<p>Springing to the window, he raised it with a prompt and vigorous
hand, and before the squire could ascend the stairs, he was upon
the roof of the portico. Throwing his boots down, he grasped the
gutter, and &ldquo;hung off.&rdquo; He was now on <em>terra
firma</em>, and all his trials appeared to have reached a happy
termination; but here again he was doomed to disappointment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bow, wow, wow-er, woo, row!&rdquo; barked and growled the
squire&rsquo;s big bull dog, when he came to realize that some
unusual occurrences were transpiring.</p>
<p>The animal was a savage brute, and was kept chained in the barn
during the day, and turned loose when the squire made his last
visit to the cattle about nine in the evening. Tom was thoroughly
alarmed when this new enemy confronted him; but fortunately he had
the self-possession to stand his ground, and not attempt to run
away, otherwise the dog would probably have torn him in pieces.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come here, Tige! Poor fellow! Come here! He&rsquo;s a
good fellow! Don&rsquo;t you know me, Tige?&rdquo; said Tom, whose
only hope seemed to be in conciliation and compromise.</p>
<p>If Tige knew him, he appeared to be very unwilling to
acknowledge the acquaintance under the present suspicious
circumstances, and at this unseemly hour. The brute barked,
snarled, howled, and growled, and manifested as strong an
indisposition to compromise as a South Carolina fire-eater. He
placed himself in front of the hero of the night&rsquo;s adventure,
as resolute and as intractable as though he had known all the facts
in the case, and intended to carry out to the letter the wishes of
his master.</p>
<p>Tom slowly retreated towards the garden fence, the dog still
following him up. He had tried coaxing and conciliation, and they
had failed. As he cautiously backed from the house, his feet struck
against a heavy cart stake, which seemed to suggest his next
resort. He was well aware that any quick movement on his part would
cause the dog to spring upon him. Placing his toe under the stake,
he raised it with his foot, till he could reach it with his hand,
keeping his gaze fixed upon the eyes of the dog, which glared like
fiery orbs in the gloom of the hour.</p>
<p>Tige saw the stick, and he appeared to have a wholesome respect
for it&mdash;a sentiment inspired by sundry beatings, intended to
cure a love of mutton on the hoof, or beef on the shelf. The brute
retreated a few paces; but at this moment Squire Pemberton appeared
at the front door, with a lantern in his hand. He understood the
&ldquo;situation&rdquo; at a glance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Take him, Tige! Stu&rsquo; boy!&rdquo; shouted the
squire.</p>
<p>The dog snarled an encouraging reply to this suggestion, and
moved up towards the fugitive. Tom&rsquo;s courage was equal to the
occasion, and he levelled a blow at the head of the bull dog,
which, if it had hit him fairly, must have smashed in his skull. As
it was, the blow was a heavy one, and Tige retreated; but the
shouts of the squire rallied him, and he rushed forward to the
onslaught again.</p>
<p>Tom, as we have before had occasion to suggest, was a master of
strategy, and instead of another stroke at the head of his savage
foe, with only one chance in ten of hitting the mark he commenced
swinging it vigorously to the right and left, as a mower does his
scythe. His object was to hit the legs of the dog&mdash;a plan
which was not entirely original with him, for he had seen it
adopted with signal success by a fisherman at the Harbor. The
consequence of this change of tactics was soon apparent, for Tige
got a rap on the fore leg, which caused him to yelp with pain, and
retire from the field. While the dog moved off in good order in one
direction, Tom effected an equally admirable retreat in the other
direction.</p>
<p>On reaching the road, he pulled on his boots, which he had
picked up after the discomfiture of his canine antagonist. Squire
Pemberton still stood at the door trying to bring Tige to a sense
of his duty in the trying emergency; but the brute had more regard
for his own shins than he had for the mandate of his master, and
the victor was permitted to bear away his laurels without further
opposition.</p>
<p>When he reached his father&rsquo;s house, supposing the front
door was locked, he went to the kitchen window, where he had heard
the patriotic remarks of his mother. Tom told his story in
substance as we have related it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you mean what you have said, mother?&rdquo; inquired
he, when he had finished his narrative.</p>
<p>Mrs. Somers bit her lip in silence for a moment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Certainly I do, Thomas,&rdquo; said she, desperately.</p>
<p>It was half-past one when the boys retired, but it was another
hour before Tom&rsquo;s excited brain would permit him to sleep.
His head was full of a big thought.</p>

<h2>Signing the Papers.</h2>
<p class="returnTOC"><a href="#Contents">Return to Table of
Contents</a></p>
<p>Thomas went to sleep at last, and, worn out by the fatigue and
excitement of the day, he slept long and soundly. His mother did
not call him till eight o&rsquo;clock, and it was nine before he
reached the store of his employer, where the recital of the
adventure of the preceding night proved to be a sufficient excuse
for his non-appearance at the usual hour.</p>
<p>In the course of the week Captain Benson had procured the
necessary authority to raise a company for three years or for the
war. When he exhibited his papers, he found twenty persons ready to
put down their names. A recruiting office was opened at the store,
and every day added to the list of brave and self-denying men who
were ready to go forward and fight the battles of liberty and
union. The excitement in Pinchbrook was fanned by the news which
each day brought of the zeal and madness of the traitors.</p>
<p>Thomas had made up his mind, even before his mother had been
surprised into giving her consent, that he should go to the war. At
the first opportunity, therefore, he wrote his name upon the paper,
very much to the astonishment of Captain Benson and his
employer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How old are you, Tom?&rdquo; asked the captain.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m in my seventeenth year,&rdquo; replied the
soldier boy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are not old enough.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m three months older than Sam Thompson; and you
didn&rsquo;t even ask him how old he was.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He is larger and heavier than you are!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t help that. I&rsquo;m older than he is, and
I think I can do as much in the way of fighting as he
can.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t doubt that,&rdquo; added the captain,
laughing. &ldquo;Your affair with Squire Pemberton shows that you
have pluck enough for anything. I should be very glad to have you
go; but what does your father say?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He hasn&rsquo;t said anything. He isn&rsquo;t at home. He
went away before Sumter was fired upon by the rebels.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;True&mdash;I remember. What does your mother
say?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;O, she is willing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you sure, Tom?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course, I am. Suppose you write something by which she
can give her consent, and she will sign it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Captain Benson drew up the document, and when Tom went home to
dinner, he presented it to his mother for her signature.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope you won&rsquo;t back out, mother,&rdquo; said he,
as she put on her spectacles, and proceeded to ascertain the
contents of the document.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Back out of what, Thomas?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve signed the muster roll, and I belong to
Captain Benson&rsquo;s company now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You!&rdquo; exclaimed Mrs. Somers, lowering the paper,
and gazing earnestly into the face of the young man, to discover
whether he was in earnest.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, mother; you said you were willing, and I have signed
the papers; but Captain Benson wants your consent in writing, so
that there shall be no mistake about it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The mother read the paper in silence and sadness, for the
thought of having her noble boy exposed to the perils of the camp
and the march, the skirmish and the battle, was terrible, and
nothing but the most exalted patriotism could induce a mother to
give a son to his country.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to sign this paper, Thomas,&rdquo;
said she, when she had finished reading it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have you forgot what you said the other night,
mother?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I haven&rsquo;t forgot it, and I feel now just as I
did then. If there is any real need of your going, I am willing you
should go.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Need? Of course there is need of soldiers. The President
wasn&rsquo;t joking when he called for seventy-five thousand
men.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But there are enough to go without you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s just what everybody might say, and then
there wouldn&rsquo;t be anybody to go.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you are young, and not very strong.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m old enough, and strong enough. When I can get a
day to myself, I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s any great hardship to
carry father&rsquo;s heavy fowling-piece from sunrise to sunset;
and I guess I can stand it to carry a musket as long as any of
them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are only a boy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I shall be a man soon enough.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;When you have gone, John will want to go too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, mother, I don&rsquo;t want to go into the
army,&rdquo; said John, with a sly wink at his brother. &ldquo;I
shall never be a soldier if I can help it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What am I going to do, if you all go off and leave
me?&rdquo; added Mrs. Somers, trying hard to keep down a tear which
was struggling for birth in her fountain of sorrows.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think you will want for anything, mother.
I&rsquo;m sure I wouldn&rsquo;t leave you, if I thought you would.
I don&rsquo;t get but two dollars and a half a week in the store,
and I shall have eleven dollars a month in the army, and it
won&rsquo;t cost me any thing for board or clothes. I will send
every dollar I get home to you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are a good boy, Thomas,&rdquo; replied Mrs. Somers,
unable any longer to restrain the tear.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know you and John both will do every thing you can for
me. If your father was only at home, I should feel different about
it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He would believe in my fighting for my country, if he
were here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know he would,&rdquo; said Mrs. Somers, as she took the
pen which Thomas handed her, and seated herself at the table.
&ldquo;If you are determined to go, I suppose you will go, whether
I am willing or not.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, mother, I will not,&rdquo; added Thomas, decidedly.
&ldquo;I shouldn&rsquo;t have signed the muster roll if you
hadn&rsquo;t said you were willing. And if you say now that you
won&rsquo;t consent, I will take my name off the paper.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you want to go&mdash;don&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do; there&rsquo;s no mistake about that: but I
won&rsquo;t go if you are not willing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Somers wrote her name upon the paper. It was a slow and
difficult operation to her, and during the time she was thus
occupied, the rest of the family watched her in silent anxiety.
Perhaps, if she had not committed herself on the eventful night
when she fully believed that Thomas had run away and joined the
army, she might have offered more and stronger objections than she
now urged. But there was a vein of patriotism in her nature, which
she had inherited from her father, who had fought at Bunker Hill,
Brandywine, and Germantown, and which had been exemplified in the
life of her brother; and this, more than any other consideration,
induced her to sign the paper.</p>
<p>Thousands of loving and devoted mothers have given their sons to
their country in the same holy enthusiasm that inspired her. She
was not a solitary instance of this noble sacrifice, and if both
her sons had been men, instead of boys, she would not have
interposed a single objection to their departure upon a mission so
glorious as that to which Thomas had now devoted himself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s my name, Thomas,&rdquo; said his mother, as
she took off her spectacles. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve done it, and you
have my free consent. You&rsquo;ve always been a good boy, and I
hope you will always be a good soldier.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I shall always try to do my duty, mother; and if ever I
turn my back to a rebel, I hope you&rsquo;ll disown me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good, Tom!&rdquo; exclaimed John, who had been deeply
interested in the event of the hour.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, Thomas, I&rsquo;d rather face two rebels than that
bull dog you fit with t&rsquo;other night,&rdquo; added
gran&rsquo;ther Greene. &ldquo;You are as bold as a lion,
Thomas.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you think I can stand it, gran&rsquo;ther?&rdquo;
added Tom, with a smile.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stand it? Well, Thomas, it&rsquo;s a hard life to be a
soldier, and I know something about it. When we marched
from&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dinner&rsquo;s ready,&rdquo; interposed Mrs. Somers, for
gran&rsquo;ther Greene had marched that march so many times that
every member of the family knew it by heart.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s one good thing about it, Tom,&rdquo; said
John: &ldquo;you have got a first-rate captain.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m thankful you are going with Captain Benson, for
if there ever was a Christian in Pinchbrook, he is the man,&rdquo;
added Mrs. Somers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And all the company will be your own friends and
neighbors,&rdquo; said gran&rsquo;ther Greene; &ldquo;and
that&rsquo;s something, I can tell you. I know something about this
business. When we marched from&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have some more beans, brother?&rdquo; asked Mrs. Somers.
&ldquo;You will be among your friends, Thomas, as gran&rsquo;ther
says.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a great thing, I can tell you,&rdquo; added
the veteran. &ldquo;Soldiers should stick together like brothers,
and feel that they are fighting for each other, as well as for the
country. Then, when you&rsquo;re sick, you want friends. When we
marched from Sackett&rsquo;s Harbor, there was a young
feller&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have some more tea, brother?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Part of a cup, Nancy,&rdquo; replied the old man, who
never took offence even when the choicest stories of his military
experience were nipped in the bud.</p>
<p>After dinner, Thomas hastened back to the store. That day seemed
to him like an epoch in his existence, as indeed it was. He felt
that he belonged to his country now, and that the honor of that old
flag, which had been insulted by traitors, was committed to his
keeping. He was taking up the work where his grandfather had left
it. He was going forth to fight for his country, and the thought
inspired him with a noble and generous enthusiasm, before which all
the aspirations of his youth vanished.</p>
<p>As he passed the house of Squire Pemberton, he bestowed a
pitying reflection upon the old traitor; but his mind was so full
of the great event which was dawning upon him, that he did not even
think of the exciting incidents which had occurred there. He had
neither seen nor heard any thing of the squire since he had escaped
from the attic chamber.</p>
<p>Just beyond the squire&rsquo;s house he met Captain Barney, who
was riding up to the town hall.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s this I hear of you, Tom?&rdquo; demanded the
captain, as he reined in his horse. &ldquo;They say you have joined
the company.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir. I have.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bravo! my boy. Good on your head! You ought to go out as
a brigadier general. What does your mother say?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have her written consent in my pocket.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right. God bless you, my boy!&rdquo; said the old
salt, as he started his horse.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you, sir. There&rsquo;s only one thing that
troubles me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Eh? What&rsquo;s that, my boy?&rdquo; demanded Captain
Barney as he reined up the horse again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose you have heard of my scrape at Squire
Pemberton&rsquo;s the other night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes; and shiver my timbers if I didn&rsquo;t want to
keelhaul the old traitor when I heard of it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t care anything about the scrape, sir; only
I&rsquo;m afraid the squire will bother my mother when I&rsquo;m
gone,&rdquo; said Thomas, with some diffidence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If he does, he&rsquo;ll settle the matter with Jack
Barney,&rdquo; replied the captain, decidedly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My father may never come back, you know, and if he does
he will be a beggar. He owes the squire a note, which will be due
in June.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll pay it myself!&rdquo; roared Captain Barney.
&ldquo;Go and fight for your country, Tom, like a man. I&rsquo;ll
call and see your mother once a week, or every day in the week, if
you say so. She shall not want for any thing as long as I have a
shot in the locker.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you, Captain Barney; thank you, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll take care of your mother, my lad, and
I&rsquo;ll take care of the squire. He shall not foreclose that
mortgage, Tom. Don&rsquo;t bother your head about any of those
things. You&rsquo;re a good boy, Tom, and I&rsquo;ll keep every
thing all right at home.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you, sir,&rdquo; repeated the soldier boy, as
Captain Barney started his horse again.</p>
<p>The captain was a retired shipmaster, of ample means, and Tom
knew that he was not only able, but willing, to do all he had
promised. His heart was lighter; a load had been removed from his
mind.</p>
<h3><a id="Ch_9" name="Ch_9">Chapter IX.</a></h3>
<h2>The Departure.</h2>
<p class="returnTOC"><a href="#Contents">Return to Table of
Contents</a></p>
<p>At the time of which we write, recruiting officers were not very
particular in regard to the age of those whom they received into
the volunteer army. If the young man seemed to have the requisite
physical qualifications, it was of little consequence what his age
was; and Tom Somers was tall enough and stout enough to make a very
good soldier.</p>
<p>Captain Benson examined the certificate brought to him by the
young recruit, not, however, because it was deemed a necessary
legal form, but because he was acquainted with his father and
mother, and would not willingly have done any thing to displease
them. The matter, therefore, was disposed of to the satisfaction of
all the parties concerned, and Tom actually commenced his career as
a soldier boy. He immediately resigned his situation in the store,
for the company now numbered forty men, not half a dozen of whom
had any knowledge whatever of military drill.</p>
<p>As the volunteers of the Pinchbrook company could ill afford to
lose the time devoted to drill before they should be mustered into
the service of the United States, the town voted to pay each man
fifteen dollars a month for three months. This generous and
patriotic action of the town rejoiced the heart of Tom Somers, for
his mother actually needed the pittance he had earned at the store.
Mrs. Somers had heard nothing from her husband; but the destruction
of the Gosport Navy Yard, and the seizure of several northern
vessels in the harbor of Norfolk, left her little to hope for in
that direction. Suddenly an impregnable wall seemed to rise up
between the North and the South, and she not only feared that
Captain Somers had lost all his worldly possessions, but that he
would hardly be able to escape himself from the fiery furnace of
secession and treason.</p>
<p>To her, therefore, the future looked dark and forbidding. She
foresaw that she and her family would be subjected to the pressure
of want, or at least be dependent upon the kindness of friends for
support. She had freely stated her fears to her children, and fully
exhibited the insufficiency of the family resources. The vote of
the town was a perfect godsend to Tom, and a fat legacy from a rich
relative would not have kindled a stronger feeling of gratitude in
his soul.</p>
<p>For the next five weeks, Tom was employed forenoon, afternoon,
and evening, in the drill, and he soon made himself proficient. The
company was recruited nearly up to its maximum number, and was then
attached to the &mdash;th regiment, which had just been formed and
ordered to Fort Warren.</p>
<p>On the 27th day of May, the company, escorted by the patriotic
citizens of Pinchbrook, marched to Boston, and Tom took a sorrowful
farewell of his mother, his brother and sisters, and a score of
anxious friends.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now don&rsquo;t let the rebels hit you in the backbone,
Thomas,&rdquo; said gran&rsquo;ther Green, as he shook the hand of
the soldier boy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, gran&rsquo;ther; if I can&rsquo;t fight, I
won&rsquo;t run away,&rdquo; replied Tom.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve got good blood in your veins, my boy:
don&rsquo;t disgrace it. I don&rsquo;t know as you&rsquo;ll ever
see me again, but God bless you, Thomas;&rdquo; and the old man
turned away to hide the tears which began to course down his
wrinkled cheek.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Be a good boy, Thomas,&rdquo; added his mother.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will, mother.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And remember what I&rsquo;ve been telling you. I&rsquo;m
not half so much afraid of your being killed by a bullet, as I am
of your being ruined by bad men.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You needn&rsquo;t fear any thing of that kind,
mother.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I shall pray that you may be saved from your friends as
well as from your enemies. We shall see you again before you go
off, I hope.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, mother; we shall not be sent south yet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t forget to read your Testament, Thomas,&rdquo;
said Mrs. Somers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I won&rsquo;t, mother,&rdquo; replied the soldier boy, as
he again shook hands with all the members of the family, kissed his
mother and his sisters, and hitching up his knapsack, took his
place in the ranks.</p>
<p>His heart seemed to be clear up in his throat. During the tender
scene he had just passed through, he had manfully resisted his
inclination to weep, but he could no longer restrain the tears.
Suddenly they came like a flood bursting the gates that confined
it, and he choked and sobbed like a little girl. He leaned upon his
musket, covering his face with his arm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a hard case,&rdquo; said private Hapgood, who
stood next to him in the ranks.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t think it would take me down like
this,&rdquo; sobbed Tom.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t blubber, Tom. Let&rsquo;s go off game,&rdquo;
added Ben Lethbridge, who stood on the other side of him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t help it, Ben.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, you can&mdash;dry up! Soldiers don&rsquo;t cry,
Tom.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, they do, my boy,&rdquo; said Hapgood, who was a
little old man, nearly ten years beyond the period of exemption
from military duty. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t blame Tom for crying, and,
in my opinion, he&rsquo;ll fight all the better for it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps he will, old un; but I don&rsquo;t think much of
a soldier that blubbers like a baby. I hope he won&rsquo;t run away
when he sees the rebels coming,&rdquo; sneered Ben.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If he does, he&rsquo;ll have a chance to see how thick
the heels of your boots are,&rdquo; answered the old man.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you mean by that, old un?&rdquo; demanded
Ben.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Attention&mdash;company! Shoulder&mdash;arms!
Forward&mdash;march!&rdquo; said the captain; and the discussion
was prevented from proceeding any further.</p>
<p>The band, which was at the head of the citizens&rsquo; column,
struck up an inspiring march, and Tom dried his tears. The escort
moved off, followed by the company. They passed the little cottage
of Captain Somers, and Tom saw the whole family except John, who
was in the escort, standing at the front gate. The old soldier
swung his hat, Tom&rsquo;s sisters and his mother waved their
handkerchiefs; but when they saw the soldier boy, they had to use
them for another purpose. Tom felt another upward pressure in the
region of the throat; but this time he choked down his rising
emotions, and saved himself from the ridicule of his more callous
companion on the left.</p>
<p>In violation of military discipline, he turned his head to take
one last, fond look at the home he was leaving behind. It might be
the last time he should ever gaze on that loved spot, now a
thousand times more dear than ever before. Never had he realized
the meaning of home; never before had he felt how closely his
heart&rsquo;s tendrils were entwined about that hallowed place.
Again, in spite of his firmness and fortitude, and in spite of the
sneers of Ben Lethbridge, he felt the hot tears sliding down his
cheek.</p>
<p>When he reached the brow of the hill which would soon hide the
little cottage from his view, perhaps forever, he gazed behind him
again, to take his last look at the familiar spot. His mother and
sister still stood at the front gate watching the receding column
in which the son and the brother was marching away to peril and
perhaps death.</p>
<p>&ldquo;God bless my mother! God bless them all!&rdquo; were the
involuntary ejaculations of the soldier boy, as he turned away from
the hallowed scene.</p>
<p>But the memory of that blessed place, sanctified by the presence
of those loving and devoted ones, was shrined in the temple of his
heart, ever to go with him in camp and march, in the perils of
battle and siege, to keep him true to his God, true to himself, and
true to those whom he had left behind him. That last look at home
and those that make it home, like the last fond gaze we bestow on
the loved and the lost, was treasured up in the garner of the
heart&rsquo;s choicest memories, to be recalled in the solemn
stillness of the midnight vigil, amid the horrors of the
battle-field when the angry strife of arms had ceased, and in the
gloom of the soldier&rsquo;s sick bed when no mother&rsquo;s hand
was near to lave the fevered brow.</p>
<p>The moment when he obtained his last view of the home of his
childhood seemed like the most eventful period of his existence.
His heart grew big in his bosom, and yet not big enough to contain
all he felt. He wept again, and his tears seemed to come from
deeper down than his eyes. He did not hear the inspiring strains of
the band, or the cheers that greeted the company as they went forth
to do and die for their country&rsquo;s imperilled cause.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Blubbering again, Tom?&rdquo; sneered Ben Lethbridge.
&ldquo;I thought you was more of a man than that, Tom
Somers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t help it, Ben,&rdquo; replied Tom, vainly
struggling to subdue his emotions.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Better go back, then. We don&rsquo;t want a great baby in
the ranks.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s nateral, Ben,&rdquo; said old Hapgood.
&ldquo;He&rsquo;ll get over it when he sees the rebels.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t believe he will. I didn&rsquo;t think you
were such a great calf, Tom.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shet up, now, Ben,&rdquo; interposed Hapgood.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll bet my life he&rsquo;ll stand fire as well as you
will. I&rsquo;ve been about in the world some, and I reckon
I&rsquo;ve as good an idee of this business as you have.
Tom&rsquo;s got a heart under his ribs.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll bet he runs away at the first fire.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll bet he won&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know I won&rsquo;t!&rdquo; exclaimed Tom, with energy,
as he drew his coat sleeve across his eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t the cock that crows the loudest that will
fight the best,&rdquo; added the old man. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll bet Tom
will be able to tell you the latest news from the front, where the
battle&rsquo;s the hottest. I fit my way up to the city of Mexico
long er old Scott, and I&rsquo;ve heard boys crow afore
today.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look here, old un! If you mean to call me a coward, why
don&rsquo;t you say so, right up and down?&rdquo; growled Ben.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Time&rsquo;ll tell, my boy. You don&rsquo;t know what
gunpowder smells like yet. If you&rsquo;d been with the fust
Pennsylvany, where I was, you&rsquo;d a-known sunthin about war.
Now, shet up, Ben; and don&rsquo;t you worry Tom any
more.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But Tom was no longer in a condition to be worried. Though still
sad at the thought of the home and friends he had left behind, he
had reduced his emotions to proper subjection, and before the
column reached Boston, he had even regained his wonted
cheerfulness. The procession halted upon the wharf, where the
company was to embark on a steamer for Fort Warren. As the boat
which was to convey them to the fort had not yet arrived, the men
were permitted to mingle with their friends on the wharf, and, of
course, Tom immediately sought out his brother. He found him
engaged in a spirited conversation with Captain Benson.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is it, Jack?&rdquo; asked the soldier boy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I want to join this company, and the captain won&rsquo;t
let me,&rdquo; replied John.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You, Jack!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did mother say so?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, but she won&rsquo;t care.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you ask her?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No; I didn&rsquo;t think of going till after I started
from home.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t think of it, Jack. It would be an awful blow
to mother to have both of us go.&rdquo;</p>
<p>For half an hour Tom argued the matter with John; but the
military enthusiasm of the latter had been so aroused by the march
and its attendant circumstances, that he could not restrain his
inclination.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If I don&rsquo;t join this company, I shall some
other,&rdquo; said John.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I shall have to go home again, if you do; for I
won&rsquo;t have mother left alone. We haven&rsquo;t been mustered
in yet. Besides, I thought you wanted to go into the
navy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do; but I&rsquo;m bound to go somehow,&rdquo; replied
John.</p>
<p>But what neither Tom nor Captain Benson could do, was
accomplished by Captain Barney, who declared John should go home
with him if he had to take him by the collar. The ardent young
patriot yielded as gracefully as he could to this persuasion.</p>
<p>The steamer having arrived, the soldiers shook hands with their
friends again, went on board, and, amid the hearty cheers of the
citizens of Pinchbrook, were borne down the bay.</p>
<h3><a id="Ch_10" name="Ch_10">Chapter X.</a></h3>
<h2>Company K.</h2>
<p class="returnTOC"><a href="#Contents">Return to Table of
Contents</a></p>
<p>Tom Somers felt that he was now a soldier indeed. While the
company remained in Pinchbrook, he had slept every night in his own
bed, and taken his meals in the kitchen of the little cottage. He
fully realized that he had bade a long farewell to all the comforts
and luxuries of home. That day, for the first time, he was to
partake of soldiers&rsquo; fare, and that night, for the first
time, he was to sleep upon a soldier&rsquo;s bed. These thoughts
did not make him repine, for before he signed the muster roll, he
had carefully considered, with the best information he could
obtain, what hardships and privations he would be called to endure.
He had made up his mind to bear all things without a murmur for the
blessed land of his birth, which now called upon her sons to defend
her from the parricidal blow of the traitor.</p>
<p>Tom had not only made up his mind to bear all these things, but
to bear them patiently and cheerfully. He had a little theory of
his own, that rather more than half of the discomforts of this
mortal life exist only in the imagination. If he only
<em>thought</em> that every thing was all right, it went a great
way towards making it all right&mdash;a very comforting and
satisfactory philosophy, which reduced the thermometer from ninety
down to seventy degrees on a hot day in summer, and raised it from
ten to forty degrees on a cold day in winter; which filled his
stomach when it was empty, alleviated the toothache or the
headache, and changed snarling babies into new-fledged angels. I
commend Tom&rsquo;s philosophy to the attention and imitation of
all my young friends, assured that nothing will keep them so happy
and comfortable as a cheerful and contented disposition.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tom Somers,&rdquo; said a voice near him, cutting short
the consoling meditation in which he was engaged.</p>
<p>His name was pronounced in a low and cautious tone, but the
voice sounded familiar to him, and he turned to ascertain who had
addressed him. He did not discover any person who appeared to be
the owner of the voice, and was leaving the position he had taken
on the forward deck of the steamer, when his name was repeated, in
the same low and cautious tone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who is it? Where are you?&rdquo; said Tom, looking all
about him, among the groups of soldiers who were gathered on
various parts of the deck, discussing the present and the
future.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here, Tom,&rdquo; replied the voice, which sounded more
familiar every time he heard it.</p>
<p>He turned his eye in the direction from which the sound
proceeded, and there, coiled up behind a heap of barrels and boxes,
and concealed by a sail-cloth which had been thrown over the goods
to protect them from an expected shower, he discovered Fred
Pemberton.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What in the name of creation are you doing there,
Fred?&rdquo; exclaimed Tom, laughing at the ludicrous attitude of
the embryo secessionist.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hush! Don&rsquo;t say a word, Tom. Sit down here where I
can talk with you,&rdquo; added Fred.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What are you doing here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell if you will keep quiet a moment. Is the
company full?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What company?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Captain Benson&rsquo;s, of course.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I want to join.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You!&rdquo; ejaculated Tom.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come, come, Tom, no blackguarding now. You and I used to
be good friends.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve nothing against you, Fred&mdash;that is, if
you&rsquo;re not a traitor.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I want to join the company.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is your father willing?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course he isn&rsquo;t; but that needn&rsquo;t make any
difference.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you don&rsquo;t believe in our cause, Fred. We
don&rsquo;t want a traitor in the ranks.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hang the cause! I want to go with the company.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hang the cause? Well, I reckon that&rsquo;s a good
recommendation.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m all right on that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you willing to take the oath of allegiance, and swear
to sustain the flag of your country?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course I am. I only followed the old man&rsquo;s lead;
but I have got enough of it. Do you think Captain Benson will take
me into the company?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps he will.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ask him&mdash;will you? You needn&rsquo;t say I&rsquo;m
here, you know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But what will your father say?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t care what he says.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tom thought, if Fred didn&rsquo;t care, he needn&rsquo;t, and
going aft, he found the captain, and proposed to him the
question.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Take him&mdash;yes. We&rsquo;ll teach him loyalty and
patriotism, and before his time is out, we will make him an
abolitionist,&rdquo; replied Captain Benson. &ldquo;What will his
father say?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;His father doesn&rsquo;t know anything about it. Fred ran
away, and followed the company into the city.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Squire Pemberton is a traitor, and I believe the army
will be the best school in the world for his son,&rdquo; added the
captain. &ldquo;It will be better for him to be with us than to be
at home. If it was the son of any other man in Pinchbrook, I
wouldn&rsquo;t take him without the consent of his father; as it
is, I feel perfectly justified in accepting him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tom hastened to the forward deck to report the success of his
mission. The result was, that Fred came out of his hiding-place,
and exhibited himself to the astonished members of the Pinchbrook
company. When he announced his intention to go to the war, and,
with a pardonable flourish, his desire to serve his country, he was
saluted with a volley of cheers. Captain Benson soon appeared on
the forward deck, and the name of the new recruit was placed on the
enlistment paper.</p>
<p>Fred was seventeen years of age, and was taller and stouter than
Tom Somers. No questions were asked in regard to his age or his
physical ability to endure the hardships of a campaign.</p>
<p>The steamer arrived at Fort Warren, and the company landed.
After waiting a short time on the wharf, the color company of the
&mdash;th regiment, to which they were attached, came down and
escorted them to the parade ground within the fort. It was a
desolate and gloomy-looking place to Tom, who had always lived
among green fields, and the beautiful surroundings of a New England
rural district.</p>
<p>If the fort itself looked dreary, how much more so were the
casemates in which the company was quartered! But Tom&rsquo;s
philosophy was proof against the unpleasant impression, and his
joke was as loud and hearty as that of any of his companions. The
men were divided off into messes, and they had an abundance of work
to do in bringing up the company&rsquo;s luggage, and making their
new habitation as comfortable and pleasant as the circumstances
would permit.</p>
<p>The next day the Pinchbrook boys were designated as Company K,
and placed in the regimental line. The limits of this volume do not
permit me to detail the every-day life of the soldier boy while at
Fort Warren, however interesting and instructive it might be to our
friends. A large portion of the forenoon was devoted to squad and
company drill, and of the afternoon to battalion drill. The
colonel, though a very diminutive man in stature, was an enthusiast
in military matters, and had the reputation of being one of the
most thorough and skilful officers in the state. Tom Somers, who,
since he joined the company, had felt ashamed of himself because he
was no bigger, became quite reconciled to his low corporeal estate
when he found that the colonel of the regiment was no taller and no
heavier than himself. And when he heard the high praise bestowed
upon the colonel&rsquo;s military skill and martial energy, he came
to the conclusion that it does not require a big man to make a good
soldier. With a feeling of satisfaction he recalled the fact that
Napoleon Bonaparte, when he commanded the army of Italy, was
scarcely a bigger man than the colonel or himself.</p>
<p>The colonel was a strict disciplinarian, and he soon diffused
his energy throughout the regiment. It made rapid progress in its
military education. Tom was deeply interested in the details of his
new profession, and used his best endeavors to do his duty promptly
and faithfully. This was not the case with all the boys in the
company from Pinchbrook, and I am sorry to say that some of them,
including the brave and chivalric Ben Lethbridge, had to sit upon
the stool of repentance in the guard room on several occasions.</p>
<p>Fred Pemberton was clothed in the uniform of the United States
volunteers, and we must do him the justice to say that he performed
his duty to the entire satisfaction of his officers. Fred was a
good fellow, and barring his treason, which he had derived from his
father, was highly esteemed by those who knew him. The only stain
that had ever rested upon his character was removed, and he and Tom
were as good friends as ever they had been. His motive in joining
the army, however, could not be applauded. He thought all his
friends were going off to the South upon a kind of frolic, spiced
with a little of peril and hardship to make it the more exciting,
and he did not like the idea of being left behind. To the sentiment
of patriotism, as developed in the soul of Tom Somers and many of
his companions, he was an entire stranger. He was going to the war
to participate in the adventures of the &mdash;th regiment, rather
than to fight for the flag which had been insulted and dishonored
by treason.</p>
<p>Every day the steamers brought crowds of visitors to the fort to
see their friends in the regiments quartered there, or to witness
the drills and parades which were constantly succeeding each other.
Among them came many of the people of Pinchbrook, and Tom was
delighted by a visit from his whole family. His mother found him so
comfortable and contented that she returned with half the heavy
burden on her soul removed.</p>
<p>While the Pinchbrook boys were generally rejoiced to see their
friends from home, there was one in the company who was in constant
dread lest he should recognize a too familiar face in the crowds
which the steamers daily poured into the fort. Fred Pemberton did
not wish to see his nearest friends; but after he had been in the
company some ten days, just as the boys had been dismissed from the
forenoon drill, he discovered at a distance the patriarchal form of
his father.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My pipe&rsquo;s out, Tom,&rdquo; said Fred, as he rushed
into the casemate where a group of his companions were resting from
the fatigues of the morning.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter now, Fred?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The old man has just come into the fort.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Has he?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes&mdash;what shall I do?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Keep a stiff upper lip, Fred, and we will put you through
all right,&rdquo; said Sergeant Porter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What shall I do?&rdquo; demanded Fred, who, whatever his
views in regard to the justice or injustice of coercion, did not
wish to be taken from the company.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come with me,&rdquo; said the sergeant, as he led the way
into an adjoining casemate. &ldquo;No; nobody else will
come,&rdquo; added he, motioning back other members of the mess who
was disposed to follow.</p>
<p>In the casemate to which Sergeant Porter conducted Fred, there
was a pile of boxes, in which the muskets of one of the regiments
had been packed. The fugitive from his father&rsquo;s anxious
search was directed to get into one of these boxes, from which the
sergeant removed the gun rests. He obeyed; his confederate put on
the lid so as to permit him to receive a plentiful supply of air,
and other boxes were placed upon that containing the runaway.</p>
<p>Squire Pemberton presented himself before Captain Benson, and
demanded his son. Fred was sent for, but could not be found.
Sergeant Porter kept out of the way, and not another man in the
company knew anything about him. The boys were very willing to
assist the indignant father in his search, but all their efforts
were unavailing. The squire examined every casemate, and every nook
and corner upon the island, but without effect.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I want my son, sir,&rdquo; said the squire, angrily, to
the captain. &ldquo;I require you to produce him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know where he is,&rdquo; replied Captain
Benson.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have concealed him, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have not.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The squire appealed to the colonel, but obtained no
satisfaction, and was obliged to leave without accomplishing his
purpose. As soon as he had gone, Fred appeared, and the boys
laughed for a week over the affair.</p>
<h3><a id="Ch_11" name="Ch_11">Chapter XI.</a></h3>
<h2>In Washington.</h2>
<p class="returnTOC"><a href="#Contents">Return to Table of
Contents</a></p>
<p>On the 17th of June, the regiment left Port Warren, and after
being conveyed by steamer to Boston, marched to Camp Cameron. Here
the &ldquo;little colonel&rdquo; displayed his energy and military
skill to much greater advantage than when within the narrow
confines of the fort. The men were not only carefully and
persistently drilled, but they were educated, as far as the
circumstances would permit, for the arduous duties of a
campaign.</p>
<p>Tom Somers had already begun to feel a soldier&rsquo;s pride in
his new situation; and though he found that being a soldier boy was
not always the easiest and the pleasantest thing in the world, he
bore his trials with philosophical patience and fortitude, and made
the most of whatever joys the circumstances placed within his
reach.</p>
<p>Others grumbled, but he did not. He declared that he had
enlisted for the war, and meant to take things as they came. It was
not exactly agreeable to stand on guard for two hours, on a cold,
rainy night; but grumbling would not make it any the more
agreeable, and only made the grumbler discontented and unhappy. It
did not look like &ldquo;the pomp and circumstance of war,&rdquo;
and no doubt most of the boys in the Pinchbrook company would have
been better satisfied in their own houses in &ldquo;the village by
the sea.&rdquo; But most of these men had left their happy homes
under the inspiration of the highest and truest motives. They were
going forth to fight the battles of their imperilled country, and
this reflection filled them with a heroism which the petty trials
and discomforts of the camp could not impair.</p>
<p>While the regiment was at Camp Cameron, the state colors and a
standard, procured by the liberality of its friends, were
presented; and the patriotic speeches delivered on this occasion
made a deep impression upon the mind and heart of the soldier boy.
To him they were real&mdash;perhaps more real than to those who
uttered the burning words. He was in a situation to feel the full
force of the great sacrifice which the soldier makes for his
country. He devoted himself, heart and soul, to the cause; and what
was but an idle sentiment in the mind of the flowery speech-makers,
was truth and soberness to him who was to meet the foe at the
cannon&rsquo;s mouth and at the bayonet&rsquo;s point.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are off on the 29th,&rdquo; said old Hapgood, one
evening, as he entered the barrack where Tom was writing a letter
to his mother.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good! I am glad to hear it. I was just telling my mother
that I hoped we should not have to stay much longer in this
place,&rdquo; replied Tom.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think we are having an easy time of it here,&rdquo;
added the veteran. &ldquo;When you find out what hunger and fatigue
mean, you will learn to be contented with such a place as
this.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m contented enough; but I want to get into the
field, and have something done.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Time enough, my boy. I used to feel just so, Tom, when I
went to Mexico; but after a while I got so I didn&rsquo;t care what
we did or where we went.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tom added a postscript to his letter, informing his mother of
the time fixed for the departure of the regiment. The intelligence
in this instance proved to be correct, for on the appointed day the
little colonel marched his command into the city, where it was duly
embarked on the cars for New York. It was a day of excitement, for
the streets of the city were thronged with people, whose cheers and
applause were the benison with which the regiment went forth to do
and to die for the nation. Tom was delighted with this warm
reception, but more by meeting his mother and his brother and
sisters at the station. It was a joyous and yet a sad meeting. Mrs.
Somers wept; and what mother would not weep to see her son go forth
to encounter the perils of the battle-field, and the greater perils
of the camp?</p>
<p>It was a sad parting; and many a mother&rsquo;s heart was torn
with anguish on that day, when she pressed her noble boy to her
bosom, for the last time, as she gave him to his country. Cold,
stern men, who had never wept before, wept then&mdash;the flesh
that was in their stony hearts yielded its unwilling tribute to
nature and affection.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All aboard!&rdquo; shouted the officers, when the train
was ready to depart.</p>
<p>&ldquo;God bless you, my boy!&rdquo; sobbed Mrs. Somers, as she
kissed her son. &ldquo;Be good and true, and don&rsquo;t forget to
read your Testament.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good by, mother,&rdquo; was all that Tom could say, as he
grasped his musket, which John had been holding for him, and rushed
into the car.</p>
<p>The train moved off amid the cheers of the thousands who had
gathered to witness their departure. At this moment, more than ever
before, the soldier boy realized what he had done when he entered
the service. He listened to the shouts of the multitude, but he was
sad and silent. He sank into his seat, and gave himself up to the
anguish of the hour. On and on dashed the train, and his thoughts
still dwelt upon the home and the mother he had left behind
him.</p>
<p>Our readers can better imagine than we can describe the feelings
of the soldier boy during that long night. The regiment arrived in
New York at half-past ten in the forenoon of the following day, and
was escorted up Broadway by the Sons of Massachusetts. At the Park,
it was warmly welcomed by the President of the Sons, and as the
little colonel was a better soldier than a speech-maker, the
response was made by the surgeon. By this time, Tom was able to
enter into the spirit of the occasion, and the flattering ovation
bestowed upon the regiment was a source of personal pride and
satisfaction. The little colonel&rsquo;s command was declared to be
the best drilled and most soldierly body of men which had yet
departed for the battle-fields of the republic.</p>
<p>The great city was full of wonders to the soldier boy, and
during the few hours he remained there, he was in a constant whirl
of excitement. If the mission before him had been less grand and
sublime, he could have wished to spend a few days in exploring the
wonders of the great metropolis; but the stupendous events that
loomed up in the future, prophetic even to the inexperienced eye of
youth, engrossed all his thoughts. He partook of the bountiful
collation in the Park, and was content to march on to scenes more
thrilling and exciting than the tumult of the busy city.</p>
<p>The regiment took a steamer, at half-past four for
Elizabethport, and thence proceeded by railroad to Washington, by
the way of Harrisburg. Some portions of the journey were performed
under the most trying circumstances. The men were crowded, like
sheep, into unsuitable cars, so that not only were they subjected
to many needless discomforts, but their very lives were endangered.
On the way, two men were crowded out of a car, and, for a time,
were supposed to have been killed.</p>
<p>On the 2d of July, they arrived at Washington, and Tom had an
opportunity to see the &ldquo;city of magnificent distances,&rdquo;
of which he had heard so much. The regiment marched from the
station, through Pennsylvania Avenue, to their camp ground in the
rear of the White House. They were received with enthusiasm by the
people, but the miserable uniforms with which they had been
supplied, now faded and dilapidated, with the finishing touch of
destruction given to them by the perilous journey they had made,
gave the politicians their first lesson on the worthlessness of
&ldquo;shoddy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The regiment entered the grounds of the White House, and as it
passed up the avenue, President Lincoln appeared in front of his
mansion. The boys greeted him with a volley of stunning cheers,
which the President acknowledged by a series of bows, which were
not half so ungraceful as one might have expected after reading the
descriptions of him contained in the newspapers.</p>
<p>To Tom Somers the President was a great institution, and he
could scarcely believe that he was looking upon the chief
magistrate of this great nation. He was filled with boyish wonder
and astonishment; but, after all, he was forced to admit that the
President, though a tall specimen of humanity, looked very much
like the rest of mankind&mdash;to borrow a phrase from one of his
illustrious predecessors.</p>
<p>Tom was too tired to wonder long at the grandeur of the Capitol,
and the simple magnificence of the President. The tents were
pitched, and the weary men were allowed a season of rest. In a
couple of days, however, our soldier boy was &ldquo;as good as
new.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come, Tom, it is about time for you too see something of
the city,&rdquo; said Ben Lethbridge, one afternoon, after the
regiment had become fairly settled in its new quarters.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I should like to take a tramp. There are lots of
congressmen here, and I should like to know what they look
like,&rdquo; replied Tom. &ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t been outside the
lines since we came here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have; and I&rsquo;m going again! Fred and I mean to
have a good time to-day. Will you go?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have you got a pass?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A pass! What a stupid! What do you want of a pass? You
can&rsquo;t get one. They won&rsquo;t give any.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then we can&rsquo;t go, of course.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bah! What a great calf you are! Don&rsquo;t you want to
cry again?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ben, you needn&rsquo;t say cry to me again as long as you
live,&rdquo; added Tom. &ldquo;If you do, I&rsquo;ll give you
something to cry for.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tom did not like the style of remark which the other had
adopted. He was angry, and, as he spoke, his fist involuntarily
clinched, and his eye looked fierce and determined.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come, come, Tom; don&rsquo;t bristle up so. If you are a
man, just show that you are, and come along with us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I say, Ben, I want to know who&rsquo;s a baby or a calf,
you or I, before we go, I won&rsquo;t stand any more of your
lip.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will you go with us?&rdquo; demanded Ben, who was rather
disposed to dodge the issue.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you mean by calling me a calf and a baby? And
this isn&rsquo;t the first time you&rsquo;ve done it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you know that every man in the regiment has
been all over the city, and without any pass? When I ask you to go,
you begin to talk about a pass.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I choose to obey orders,&rdquo; replied Tom.</p>
<p>&ldquo;O, you daresn&rsquo;t go with us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come along!&rdquo; said Tom, who had not yet learned to
bear the taunts of his companion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Get your pail.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tom got his pail, and was immediately joined by Fred and Ben,
each of whom was also supplied with a pail. There was no water to
be had within the camp ground, and the men were obliged to bring it
in pails from the hydrants in the street. A pail, therefore, was
quite as good as a written document to enable them to pass the
guard.</p>
<p>The party thus provided had no difficulty in passing the
sentinels. At a convenient place outside the line, they concealed
the pails, and, for three hours, roamed at will over the city.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, Tom, you wanted to see the congressmen?&rdquo; said
Ben, after they had &ldquo;done&rdquo; the city pretty
thoroughly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, but I have seen them at the Capitol.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But don&rsquo;t you want to get nearer to them, and hear
them talk?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I should like to.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come with us, then.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ben led the way down the avenue, and entered a building not far
from the railroad station. After passing through a long, narrow
entry, they ascended a flight of stairs, at the head of which the
conductor gave two raps. The door was opened by a negro, and they
were invited to enter. At a table in the middle of the room was
seated a foppish-looking man who held in his hand a silver box. As
he turned it, Tom saw that it contained a pack of cards.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where are your congressmen?&rdquo; asked the soldier boy,
whose eyes had been opened by the appearance of the cards.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They will be here pretty soon,&rdquo; replied Ben.</p>
<p>The foppish man looked at his watch, and declared they would
come in the course of five or ten minutes. He then took the cards
out of the box, and, after shuffling them, returned them to their
place. Fred placed a &ldquo;quarter&rdquo; on the table; the
gambler put another by its side, and drew out a card from the
silver case. Tom did not understand the game; but his companion put
the quarters in his pocket.</p>
<p>&ldquo;See that, Tom!&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;Got any
money?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If I have I shall keep it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Put down a quarter, and make another.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, sir! I&rsquo;m no gambler!&rdquo; replied Tom, with
emphasis.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Quite respectable, I assure you,&rdquo; added the
blackleg at the table.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going,&rdquo; said Tom, decidedly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Baby!&rdquo; sneered Ben. &ldquo;Afraid to
play!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I <em>won&rsquo;t</em> play! I&rsquo;m going.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The negro opened the door, and he passed out. Contrary to his
expectation, he was followed by Fred and Ben.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Baby is afraid of cards!&rdquo; sneered Ben, as they
passed through the long entry.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Afraid of cards, but not afraid of you,&rdquo; replied
Tom, as he planted a heavy blow between the eyes of his
companion.</p>
<p>Ben Lethbridge returned the blow, and it cost him another, and
there was a prospect of quite a lively skirmish in the entry; but
Fred Pemberton interposed his good offices, and effected a
compromise, which, like most of the political compromises, was only
the postponement of the conflict.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I told you not to call me &lsquo;baby,&rsquo;
again,&rdquo; said Tom, as they passed out of the building.
&ldquo;I will convince you before I am done that I&rsquo;m not a
baby.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ben found it convenient to offer no reply to this plain
statement of facts, and the three soldiers made their way back to
the camp, and, having obtained their pails and filled them with
water at the hydrants, they passed the guard without a
question.</p>
<h3><a id="Ch_12" name="Ch_12">Chapter XII.</a></h3>
<h2>On to Richmond.</h2>
<p class="returnTOC"><a href="#Contents">Return to Table of
Contents</a></p>
<p>It so happened that Ben Lethbridge, probably satisfied that it
was not the fist of a baby which had partially blackened both of
his eyes, and produced a heavy pain under his left ear, did not
demand the satisfaction which was needed to heal his wounded honor.
The matter was duly discussed in the tent of Tom&rsquo;s mess; but
our soldier boy, while he professed to be entirely satisfied, was
willing to meet Ben at such time and place as he desired, and
finish up the affair.</p>
<p>The other party was magnanimous, and declared that he too was
satisfied; and old Hapgood thought they had better proceed no
further with the affair, for both of them might be arrested for
disorderly conduct.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am satisfied, Ben; but if you ever call me a baby or a
calf again, it will all have to be settled over again,&rdquo; said
Tom, as he laid aside his musket, which he had been cleaning during
the conversation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to quarrel with you, Tom,&rdquo;
replied Ben, &ldquo;but I wish you would be a little more like the
rest of the fellows.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you mean by that? I am like the rest of the
fellows.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You wouldn&rsquo;t play cards.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I will play cards, but I won&rsquo;t gamble; and
there isn&rsquo;t many fellows in the company that will.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s so,&rdquo; added Hapgood. &ldquo;I know all
about that business. When I went to Mexico, I lost my money as fast
as I got it, playing cards. Don&rsquo;t gamble, boys.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I won&rsquo;t, for one,&rdquo; said Tom, with
emphasis.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you going to set up for a soldier-saint, too?&rdquo;
sneered Ben, turning to the old man.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m no saint, but I&rsquo;ve larned better than to
gamble.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think you&rsquo;d better stop drinking too,&rdquo;
added Ben.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come, Ben, you are meaner than dirt,&rdquo; said Tom,
indignantly.</p>
<p>Old Hapgood was a confirmed toper. The people in Pinchbrook said
he was a good man, but, they used to add, with a shrug of the
shoulders, &ldquo;pity he drinks.&rdquo; It was a sad pity, but he
seemed to have no power over his appetite. The allusion of Ben to
his besetting sin was cruel and mortifying, for the old man had
certainly tried to reform, and since the regiment left Boston, he
had not tasted the intoxicating cup. He had declared before the
mess that he had stopped drinking; so his resolution was known to
all his companions, though none of them had much confidence in his
ability to carry it out.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t speak to you, Tom Somers,&rdquo; said Ben,
sharply.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You said a mean thing in my presence.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;By and by we shall be having a prayer meeting in our tent
every night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you are invited I hope you will come,&rdquo; added
Tom, &ldquo;for if prayers will do any body any good, they
won&rsquo;t hurt you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you will take care of yourself, and let me alone,
it&rsquo;s all I ask of you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m agreed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This was about the last of the skirmishing between Tom and Ben.
The latter was a little disposed to be bully; and from the time the
company left Pinchbrook, he had been in the habit of calling Tom a
baby, and other opprobrious terms, till the subject of his sneers
could endure them no longer. Tom had come to the conclusion that he
could obtain respectful treatment only by the course he had
adopted. Perhaps, if he had possessed the requisite patience, he
might have attained the same result by a less repulsive and more
noble policy.</p>
<p>The regiment remained in Washington about a fortnight. The
capital was no longer considered to be in danger. A large body of
troops had been massed in and around the city, and the
rebels&rsquo; boast that they would soon capture Washington was no
longer heeded. Fear and anxiety had given place to hope and
expectation. &ldquo;On to Richmond!&rdquo; was the cry sounded by
the newspapers, and repeated by the people. The army of
newly-fledged soldiers was burning with eagerness to be led against
the rebels. &ldquo;On to Richmond!&rdquo; shouted citizens and
soldiers, statesmen and politicians. Some cursed and some
deprecated the cautious slowness of the old general who had never
been defeated.</p>
<p>&ldquo;On to Richmond!&rdquo; cried the boys in Tom&rsquo;s
regiment, and none more earnestly than he.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t hurry old Scott. He knows what he is about. I
know something about this business, for I&rsquo;ve seen old Scott
where the bullets flew thicker&rsquo;n snow flakes at
Christmas,&rdquo; was the oft-repeated reply of Hapgood, the
veteran of Company K.</p>
<p>The movement which had been so long desired and expected was
made at last, and the regiment struck its tents, and proceeded over
Long Bridge into Virginia. The first camp was at Shuter&rsquo;s
Hill, near Alexandria.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now we are in for it,&rdquo; said Tom Somers, when the
mess gathered in their tent after the camp was formed. &ldquo;I
hope we shall not remain here long.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be in a hurry, my brave boy,&rdquo; said old
Hapgood. &ldquo;We may stop here a month.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope not.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t hope anything about it, Tom. Take things as
they come.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But the impatience of the soldier boy was soon relieved; for at
daylight on the morning of the 16th of July, the regiment was
routed out, the tents were struck, and at nine o&rsquo;clock they
took up the line of march to the southward. It was &ldquo;on to
Richmond,&rdquo; in earnest, now, and merrily marched the men, who
little knew what trials and sufferings, what scenes of blood and
death, lay in their path.</p>
<p>The little colonel&rsquo;s command had been put in
Franklin&rsquo;s brigade, which formed a part of
Heintzelman&rsquo;s division; but little did Tom or his
fellow-soldiers know of anything but their own regiment. The
&ldquo;sacred soil&rdquo; of Virginia seemed to be covered with
Federal soldiers, and whichever way he turned, columns of troops
might be seen, all obedient to the one grand impulse of the loyal
nation&mdash;&ldquo;On to Richmond.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The great wagons, gun carriages, and caissons rolling slowly
along, the rattling drums, with here and there the inspiring
strains of a band, the general officers, with their staffs, were
full of interest and excitement to the soldier boy; and though the
business before him was stern and terrible, yet it seemed like some
great pageant, moving grandly along to celebrate, rather than win,
a glorious triumph.</p>
<p>The novelty of the movement, however, soon wore away, and it
required only a few hours to convince the inexperienced soldiers in
our regiment that it was no idle pageant in which they were
engaged. The short intervals of rest which were occasionally
allowed were moments to be appreciated. All day long they toiled
upon their weary way, praying for the night to come, with its
coveted hours of repose. The night did come, but it brought no rest
to the weary and footsore soldiers.</p>
<p>Tom was terribly fatigued. His knapsack, which had been light
upon his buoyant frame in the morning, now seemed to weigh two
hundred pounds, while his musket had grown proportionally heavy.
Hour after hour, in the darkness of that gloomy night, he trudged
on, keeping his place in the ranks with a resolution which neither
the long hours nor the weary miles could break down.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t stand this much longer,&rdquo; whined Ben
Lethbridge. &ldquo;I shall drop pretty soon, and die by the
roadside.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, you won&rsquo;t,&rdquo; added Hapgood. &ldquo;Stick
to it a little while longer; never say die.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t stand it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, you can. Only think you can, and you can,&rdquo;
added the veteran.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do they think we are made of? We can&rsquo;t march
all day and all night. I wish I was at home.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wish I hadn&rsquo;t come,&rdquo; said Fred
Pemberton.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Cheer up! cheer up, boys. Stick to it a little
longer,&rdquo; said the veteran.</p>
<p>It was three o&rsquo;clock the next morning before they were
permitted to halt, when the boys rolled themselves up in their
blankets, and dropped upon the ground. It was positive enjoyment to
Tom, and he felt happy; for rest was happiness when the body was
all worn out. A thought of the cottage and of his mother crossed
his mind, and he dropped asleep to dream of the joys of home.</p>
<p>Short and sweet was that blessed time of rest; for at four
o&rsquo;clock, after only one brief hour of repose, the regiment
was turned out again, and resumed its weary march to the southward.
But that short interval of rest was a fountain of strength to Tom,
and without a murmur he took his place by the side of his grumbling
companions. Ben and Fred were disgusted with the army, and wanted
to go back; but that was impossible.</p>
<p>Again, for weary hours, they toiled upon the march. They passed
Fairfax, and encamped near the railroad station, where a full
night&rsquo;s rest was allowed them. By the advice of Hapgood, Tom
went to a brook, and washed his aching feet in cold water. The
veteran campaigner gave him other useful hints, which were of great
service to him. That night he had as good reason to bless the
memory of the man who invented sleep as ever Sancho Panza had, and
every hour was fully improved.</p>
<p>At six o&rsquo;clock, the next morning, the regiment marched
again. Tom&rsquo;s legs were stiff, but he felt so much better than
on the preceding day, that he began to think that he could stand
any thing. In the early part of the afternoon his ears were saluted
by a new sound&mdash;one which enabled him more fully than before
to realize the nature of the mission upon which he had been sent.
It was the roar of cannon. On that day was fought the battle of
Blackburn&rsquo;s Ford; and when the regiment reached its
halting-place at Centreville, the story of the fight was told by
enthusiastic lips. Massachusetts men had stood firm and resolute
before the artillery and musketry of the rebels, and every man who
heard the story was proud that he hailed from the Old Bay State,
and panted for the time when he might show himself worthy of his
origin, and true to the traditions of the past.</p>
<p>The regiment lay in camp the two following days, and the men had
an opportunity to recover in some measure from the fatigues of
their first severe march. Visions of glory and victory were
beginning to dawn upon them. They had listened to the cannon of the
enemy, and they knew that the rebels were not many miles distant in
front of them. A few days, perhaps a few hours, would elapse before
the terrible conflict would commence. Some of those manly forms
must soon sleep in the soldier&rsquo;s grave; some of those beating
hearts must soon cease to beat forever; but still the brave and the
true longed for the hour that would enable them to &ldquo;strike
home&rdquo; for the nation&rsquo;s salvation.</p>
<h3><a id="Ch_13" name="Ch_13">Chapter XIII.</a></h3>
<h2>The Battle of Bull Run.</h2>
<p class="returnTOC"><a href="#Contents">Return to Table of
Contents</a></p>
<p>&ldquo;Tumble out! Tumble out!&rdquo; shouted the sergeant, who
was in the mess with the soldiers we have introduced.
&ldquo;Reveille! Don&rsquo;t you hear it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But it isn&rsquo;t morning,&rdquo; growled Ben
Lethbridge.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t been asleep more than an hour or
two,&rdquo; snarled Fred Pemberton.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shut up your heads, and turn out!&rdquo; said the
sergeant.</p>
<p>It was the morning of the eventful twenty-first of July, and it
was only two o&rsquo;clock when the regiment was roused from its
slumbers; but there was no great hardship in this fact, for most of
the men had been sleeping the greater portion of the time during
the preceding two days. Tom Somers was ready to take his place in
the line in a few moments.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come, fellows, hurry up,&rdquo; said he to his tardy
companions. &ldquo;The time has come, and, I tell you,
there&rsquo;ll be music before many hours.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where are we going, Tom? Have you any idea?&rdquo; asked
Fred.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Going down to Manassas Junction, I suppose. That&rsquo;s
where the rebels are.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you suppose we shall get into a fight?&rdquo; asked
Ben.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know; I hope so.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So do I,&rdquo; returned Ben, faintly; &ldquo;but I
don&rsquo;t like to be broke of my rest in this way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tom, full of excited anticipations in regard to the events of
the day, laughed heartily at this reply, and left the tent. The
regiment was formed in line, but there were two vacancies in the
section to which he belonged. Fred and Ben had answered to their
names at roll call. On some pretence they had asked permission to
leave the line for a few moments, and that was the last that had
been seen of them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where do you suppose they are?&rdquo; said Tom to
Hapgood.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know. I hain&rsquo;t got much confidence in
Ben&rsquo;s pluck, and I shouldn&rsquo;t wonder if he had run
away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But that is desertion.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s just what you may call it; and I&rsquo;ve
seen men shot for it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The regiment remained in line several hours before the order
came to move. At daylight, while the men were still standing in the
road, four soldiers, attended by a staff officer, conducted the two
missing men of Company K into the presence of the regiment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;These men say they belong to your regiment,&rdquo; said
the officer, saluting the little colonel.</p>
<p>Captain Benson immediately claimed them, and Fred and Ben were
ordered into the ranks.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Cowards&mdash;are you?&rdquo; said the captain.
&ldquo;You shall take your places in the ranks, and at the right
time we will settle this case.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I enlisted without my father&rsquo;s consent, and you
can&rsquo;t hold me if I don&rsquo;t choose to stay,&rdquo; replied
Fred Pemberton.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Next time you must ask your father before you come. It is
too late to repent now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going home.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, you&rsquo;re not. Sergeant, if either of those men
attempt to leave the ranks again, shoot them!&rdquo; said the
captain.</p>
<p>Fred and Ben took their places in the ranks amid the laughter
and jeers of the company.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who&rsquo;s the baby now?&rdquo; said Bob Dornton.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have disgraced the company,&rdquo; added old Hapgood.
&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t think you would run away before the battle
commenced.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I shall keep both eyes on you, my boys, and if you skulk
again, I&rsquo;ll obey orders&mdash;by the Lord Harry, I
will!&rdquo; said the sergeant, as he glanced at the lock of his
musket. &ldquo;Company K isn&rsquo;t going to be laughed at for
your cowardice.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At six o&rsquo;clock the order came for the brigade to march. It
now consisted of only three regiments, for the time of one,
composed of three months&rsquo; men, had expired while at
Centreville; and though requested and importuned to remain a few
days longer, they basely withdrew, even while they were on the very
verge of the battlefield. This regiment left, and carried with it
the scorn and contempt of the loyal and true men, who were as ready
to fight the battles of their country on one day as on another.</p>
<p>The men knew they were going to battle now, for the enemy was
only a few miles distant. The soldier boy&rsquo;s heart was full of
hope. He knew not what a battle was; he could form no adequate
conception of the terrible scene which was soon to open upon his
view. He prayed and trusted that he might be able to do his duty
with courage and fidelity. To say that he had no doubts and fears
would be to say that he was not human.</p>
<p>As the brigade toiled slowly along, he tried to picture the
scene which was before him, and thus make himself familiar with its
terrors before he was actually called to confront them. He
endeavored to imagine the sounds of screaming shells and whistling
bullets, that the reality, when it came, might not appall him. He
thought of his companions dropping dead around him, of his friends
mangled by bayonets and cannon shot; he painted the most terrible
picture of a battle which his imagination could conjure up, hoping
in this manner to be prepared for the worst.</p>
<p>The day was hot, and the sun poured down his scorching rays upon
the devoted soldiers as they pursued their weary march. They were
fatigued by continued exertion, and some of the weary ones, when
the sun approached the meridian, began to hope the great battle
would not take place on that day. Tom Somers, nearly worn out by
the tedious march, and half famished after the scanty breakfast of
hard bread he had eaten before daylight, began to feel that he was
in no condition to face the storm of bullets which he had been
imagining.</p>
<p>No orders came to halt at noon, though the crowded roads several
times secured them a welcome rest: but on marched the weary
soldiers, till the roar of cannon broke upon their ears; and as
they moved farther on, the rattling volleys of musketry were heard,
denoting that the battle had already commenced. These notes of
strife were full of inspiration to the loyal and patriotic in the
columns. A new life was breathed into them. They were enthusiastic
in the good cause, and their souls immediately became so big that
what had been body before seemed to become spirit now. They forgot
their empty stomachs and their weary limbs. The music of battle,
wild and terrible as it was to these untutored soldiers, charmed
away the weariness of the body, and, to the quickstep of thundering
cannon and crashing musketry, they pressed on with elastic tread to
the horrors before them.</p>
<p>Tom felt that he had suddenly and miraculously been made over
anew. He could not explain the reason, but his legs had ceased to
ache, his feet to be sore, and his musket and his knapsack were
deprived of their superfluous weight.</p>
<p>&ldquo;God be with me in this battle!&rdquo; he exclaimed to
himself a dozen times. &ldquo;God give me strength and
courage!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Animated by his trust in Him who will always sustain those who
confide in him, the soldier boy pressed on, determined not to
disgrace the name he bore. The terrible sounds became more and more
distinct as the regiment advanced, and in about two hours after the
battle had opened, the brigade arrived at the field of operations.
One regiment was immediately detached and sent off in one
direction, while the other two were ordered to support a battery on
a hill, from which it was belching forth a furious storm of shells
upon the rebels.</p>
<p>The little colonel&rsquo;s sword gleamed in the air, as he gave
the order to march on the double-quick to the position assigned to
him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, Tom, steady, and think of nothing but God and your
country,&rdquo; said old Hapgood, as the regiment commenced its
rapid march. &ldquo;I know something about this business, and I can
tell you we shall have hot work before we get through with
it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where are the rebels? I don&rsquo;t see any,&rdquo; asked
Tom, who found that his ideas of the manner in which a battle is
fought were very much at fault.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You will see them very soon. They are in their
breastworks. There! Look down there!&rdquo; exclaimed the veteran
as the regiment reached a spot which commanded a full view of the
battle.</p>
<p>Tom looked upon the fearful scene. The roar of the artillery and
the crash of the small arms were absolutely stunning. He saw men
fall, and lie motionless on the ground, where they were trampled
upon by the horses, and crushed beneath the wheels of cannon and
caisson. But the cry was, that the army of the Union had won the
field, and it inspired him with new zeal and new courage.</p>
<p>Scarcely had the remnant of the brigade reached the right of the
battery, before they were ordered to charge down the valley, by
Colonel Franklin, the acting brigadier. They were executing the
command with a dash and vigor that would have been creditable to
veterans, when they were ordered to cross the ravine, and support
the Eire Zouaves. The movement was made, and Tom soon found himself
in the thickest of the fight. Shot and shell were flying in every
direction, and the bullets hissed like hailstones around him.</p>
<p>In spite of all his preparations for this awful scene, his heart
rose up into his throat. His eyes were blinded by the volumes of
rolling smoke, and his mind confused by the rapid succession of
incidents that were transpiring around him. The pictures he had
painted were sunlight and golden compared with the dread reality.
Dead and dying men strewed the ground in every direction. Wounded
horses were careering on a mad course of destruction, trampling the
wounded and the dead beneath their feet. The hoarse shouts of the
officers were heard above the roar of battle. The scene mocked all
the attempts which the soldier boy had made to imagine its
horrors.</p>
<p>In front of the regiment were the famous Eire Zouaves, no longer
guided and controlled by the master genius of Ellsworth. They
fought like tigers, furiously, madly; but all discipline had ceased
among them, and they rushed wildly to the right and the left,
totally heedless of their officers. They fought like demons, and as
Tom saw them shoot down, hew down, or bayonet the hapless rebels
who came within their reach, it seemed to him as though they had
lost their humanity, and been transformed into fiends.</p>
<p>As soon as the regiment reached its position, the order was
given to fire. Tom found this a happy relief; and when he had
discharged his musket a few times, all thoughts of the horrors of
the scene forsook him. He no longer saw the dead and the dying; he
no longer heard the appalling roar of battle. He had become a part
of the scene, instead of an idle spectator. He was sending the bolt
of death into the midst of the enemies of his country.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bravo! Good boy, Tom,&rdquo; said old Hapgood, who seemed
to be as much at ease as when he had counselled patience and
resignation in the quiet of the tent. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t fire too
high, Tom.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got the idea,&rdquo; replied the soldier boy.
&ldquo;I begin to feel quite at home.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;O, you&rsquo;ll do; and I knew you would from the
first.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The shouts of victory which had sounded over the field were full
of inspiration to the men; but at the moment when the laurels
seemed to be resting securely upon our banners, the rebel line
moved forward with irresistible fury. Tom, at one instant, as he
cast his eye along the line, found himself flanked on either side
by his comrades; at the next there was a wild, indescribable tramp
and roar, and he found himself alone. The regiment was scattered in
every direction, and he did not see a single man whom he knew.
There was a moving mass of Federal soldiers all around him. The
Zouaves had been forced back, and the cry of victory had given
place to the ominous sounds which betokened a defeat, if not a
rout.</p>
<p>The rebels had been re&euml;nforced, and had hurled their fresh
legions upon our exhausted troops, who could no longer roll back
the masses that crowded upon them. The day was lost.</p>
<p>Tom, bewildered by this sudden and disastrous result, moved back
with the crowds around him. Men had ceased to be brave and firm;
they were fleeing in mortal terror before the victorious battalions
that surged against them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s all up with us, my lad,&rdquo; said a panting
Zouave. &ldquo;Run for your life. Come along with me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tom followed the Zouave towards the woods, the storm of bullets
still raining destruction around them.</p>
<h3><a id="Ch_14" name="Ch_14">Chapter XIV.</a></h3>
<h2>After the Battle.</h2>
<p class="returnTOC"><a href="#Contents">Return to Table of
Contents</a></p>
<p>Tom Somers floated with the tide of humanity that was setting
away from the scene of disaster and defeat. The panic that
prevailed was even more fearful than the battle, for wounded and
dying men were mercilessly trodden down by the feet of the horses,
and run over by the wheels of the cannon and the baggage wagons.
Though the battle was ended, the rebels still poured storms of shot
and shell into the retreating, panic-stricken host.</p>
<p>Tom did not know where to go, for there were panic and death on
all sides of him. The soldiers were flying in every direction, some
of them into the very arms of their remorseless enemies. But the
woods seemed to promise the most secure retreat from the fury of
the Black Horse Cavalry, which was now sweeping over the
battle-field. The Zouave ran in this direction, and our soldier boy
followed him. Now that the excitement of the conflict was over, the
enthusiasm which had buoyed him up began to subside. The day was
lost; all hopes of glory had fled; and a total defeat and rout were
not calculated to add much strength to his over-tasked limbs.</p>
<p>He was nearly used up, and it was hard work to run&mdash;very
hard work; and nothing but the instinct of self-preservation
enabled him to keep the tall and wiry form of the Zouave in sight.
They reached the ravine, where the water was about three feet deep.
The shot, and shell, and bullets still fell in showers around them,
and occasionally one of the luckless fugitives was struck down.
They crossed the stream, and continued on their flight. An officer
on horseback dashed by them, and bade them run with all their
might, or they would be taken.</p>
<p>&ldquo;For Heaven&rsquo;s sake, get me some water!&rdquo; said a
rebel, who was wounded in the leg, to a Zouave, who passed near
him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are a rebel, but I will do that for you,&rdquo;
replied the Zouave; and he gave him a canteen filled with
water.</p>
<p>The rebel drank a long, deep draught, and then levelled his
musket at the head of his Samaritan enemy and fired. This
transaction had occupied but a moment, and Tom saw the whole. His
blood froze with horror at the unparalleled atrocity of the act.
The Zouave, whom Tom had followed, uttered a terrible oath, and
snatching the musket from the hands of the soldier boy, he rushed
upon the soulless miscreant, and transfixed him upon the bayonet.
Uttering fierce curses all the time, he plunged the bayonet again
and again into the vitals of the rebel, till life was extinct.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Boy, I used to be human once,&rdquo; said the Zouave,
when he had executed this summary justice upon the rebel;
&ldquo;but I&rsquo;m not human now. I&rsquo;m all devil.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What a wretch that rebel was!&rdquo; exclaimed Tom, who
seemed to breathe freer now that retribution had overtaken the
viper.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A wretch! Haven&rsquo;t you got any bigger word than
that, boy? He was a fiend! But we mustn&rsquo;t stop
here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thought the rebels were human.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Human? That isn&rsquo;t the first time to-day I&rsquo;ve
seen such a thing as that done. Come along, my boy; come
along.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tom followed the Zouave again; but he was too much exhausted to
run any farther. Even the terrors of the Black Horse Cavalry could
not inspire him with strength and courage to continue his flight at
any swifter pace than a walk.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can go no farther,&rdquo; said he, at last.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, you can; pull up! pull up! You will be taken if you
stop here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t help it. I can go no farther. I am used
up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pull up, pull up, my boy!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I don&rsquo;t want to leave you here. They&rsquo;ll
murder you&mdash;cut your throat, like a dog.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will hide myself in the bushes till I get a little more
strength.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Try it a little longer. You are too good a fellow to be
butchered like a calf,&rdquo; added the generous Zouave.</p>
<p>But it was no use to plead with him, for exhausted nature
refused to support him, and he dropped upon the ground like a
log.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Poor fellow! I would carry you in my arms if I
could.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Save yourself if you can,&rdquo; replied Tom,
faintly.</p>
<p>The kind-hearted fireman was sorry to leave him, but he knew
that one who wore his uniform could expect no mercy from the
rebels. They had been too terrible upon the battle-field to receive
any consideration from those whom they had so severely punished. He
was, therefore, unwilling to trust himself to the tender mercies of
the cavalry, who were sweeping the fields to pick up prisoners; and
after asking Tom&rsquo;s name and regiment, he reluctantly left
him.</p>
<p>Tom had eaten nothing since daylight in the morning, which,
added to the long march, and the intense excitement of his first
battle-field, had apparently reduced him to the last extremity.
Then, for the first time, he realized what it was to be a soldier.
Then he thought of his happy home&mdash;of his devoted mother. What
must she not suffer when the telegraph should flash over the wires
the intelligence of the terrible disaster which had overtaken the
Union army! It would be many days, if not weeks or months, before
she could know whether he was dead or alive. What anguish must she
not endure!</p>
<p>He had but a moment for thoughts like these before he heard the
sweep of the rebel cavalry, as they dashed down the road through
the woods. He must not remain where he was, or the record of his
earthly career would soon be closed. On his hands and knees he
crawled away from the road, and rolled himself up behind a rotten
log, just in season to escape the observation of the cavalrymen as
they rode by the spot.</p>
<p>Here and there in the woods were the extended forms of Federals
and rebels, who had dragged their wounded bodies away from the
scene of mortal strife to breathe their last in this holy sanctuary
of nature, or to escape from the death-dealing shot, and the
mangling wheels that rumbled over the dead and the dying. Close by
the soldier boy&rsquo;s retreat lay one who was moaning piteously
for water. Tom had filled his canteen at a brook on the way, and he
crawled up to the sufferer to lave his dying thirst. On reaching
the wounded man, he found that he was a rebel, and the fate of the
Zouave who had done a similar kindness only a short time before
presented itself to his mind.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Water! Water! For the love of God, give me a drop of
water,&rdquo; moaned the dying soldier.</p>
<p>Tom thought of the Zouave again, and had almost steeled his
heart against the piteous cry. He turned away.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Water! Water! If you are a Christian give me some
water,&rdquo; groaned the sufferer.</p>
<p>Our soldier boy could no longer resist the appeal. He felt that
he could not be loved on earth or forgiven in heaven if he denied
the petition of the dying rebel; but before he granted it, he
assured himself that the sufferer had no dangerous weapon in his
possession. The man was deadly pale; one of his arms hung useless
by his side; and he was covered with blood. He was a
terrible-looking object, and Tom felt sick and faint as he gazed
upon him.</p>
<p>Placing his canteen at the lips of the poor wretch, he bade him
drink. His frame quivered as he clutched the canteen with his
remaining hand. The death damp was on his forehead; but his eye
lighted up with new lustre as he drank the grateful beverage.</p>
<p>&ldquo;God bless you! God bless you!&rdquo; exclaimed he as he
removed the canteen from his lips. &ldquo;You are a Yankee,&rdquo;
he added, as he fixed his glazing eyes upon Tom&rsquo;s uniform.
&ldquo;Are you wounded?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No; I am worn out. I have eaten nothing since daylight,
and not much then. I am used up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Put your hand in my haversack. There is something
there,&rdquo; gasped the dying man.</p>
<p>Tom bent over him to comply with the invitation; but, with a
thrill of horror, he started back, as he listened to the
death-rattle in the throat of the rebel, and saw his eyes fixed and
lustreless in death. It was an awful scene to the inexperienced
youth. Though he had seen hundreds fall in the battle of that day,
death had not seemed so ghastly and horrible to him as now, when he
stood face to face with the grim monster. For a few moments he
forgot his own toil-worn limbs, his craving hunger, and his aching
head.</p>
<p>He gazed upon the silent form before him, which had ceased to
suffer, and he felt thankful that he had been able to mitigate even
a single pang of the dying rebel. But not long could he gaze,
awe-struck, at the ghastly spectacle before him, for he had a life
to save. The words of the sufferer&mdash;his last
words&mdash;offering him the contents of his haversack recurred to
him; but Tom&rsquo;s sensibilities recoiled at the thought of
eating bread taken from the body of a dead man, and he turned
away.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why shouldn&rsquo;t I take it?&rdquo; said he to himself.
&ldquo;It may save my life. With rest and food, I may escape. Pooh!
I&rsquo;ll not be a fool!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bending over the dead man, he resolutely cut the haversack from
his body, and then returned to the log whose friendly shelter had
screened him from the eyes of the rebel horsemen. Seating himself
upon the ground, he commenced exploring the haversack. It contained
two &ldquo;ash-cakes,&rdquo; a slice of bacon, and a small bottle.
Tom&rsquo;s eyes glowed with delight as he gazed upon this rich
feast, and, without waiting to say grace or consider the
circumstances under which he obtained the materials for his feast,
he began to eat. Ash-cake was a new institution to him. It was an
Indian cake baked in the ashes, probably at the camp-fires of the
rebels at Manassas. It tasted very much like his mother&rsquo;s
johnny-cake, only he missed the fresh butter with which he had been
wont to cover the article at home.</p>
<p>The soldier boy ate the bacon, and ate both of the cakes, though
each of the latter was about the size of a saucer. It was a large
meal, even for a growing boy; but every mouthful seemed to put a
new sinew into his frame. While he was eating, he drew the cork
from the bottle. It contained whiskey. Tom had heard that there was
virtue in whiskey; that it was invigorating to a tired man, and he
was tempted, under these extremely trying circumstances, to
experiment upon the beverage. He would certainly have been
excusable if he had done so; but our hero had a kind of horror of
the article, which would not let him even taste it. He was afraid
that he should acquire a habit which would go with him through
life, and make him what Hapgood and others whom he knew
were&mdash;a torment to themselves, and a nuisance to their
fellow-beings. Putting the cork in the bottle, he threw it upon the
ground.</p>
<p>With his renewed strength came renewed hope; but he did not deem
it prudent to wander about the woods at present: therefore he threw
himself on the ground under the protecting log to obtain the repose
he so much needed.</p>
<p>He thought of home, and wondered whether he should ever see the
cottage of his parents again; and while he was thinking, overcome
by the excitement and fatigue of the day, he dropped asleep. It was
strange that he could do so, consciously environed by so many
perils; but he had in a measure become callous to danger, and he
slept long and deep.</p>
<p>When he awoke, it was dark and silent around him. The roar of
battle had ceased, and the calm of death seemed to have settled
upon the scene of strife. Tom&rsquo;s bones still ached; but he was
wonderfully refreshed by the nap he had taken. He had no idea of
the time, and could not tell whether he had slept one hour or six.
He was strong enough to walk now, and the first consideration was
to escape from the vicinity of the rebel camps; but he had no
conception of where he was, or what direction would lead him to the
Federal lines.</p>
<p>A kind Providence had watched over him thus far; had spared his
life in the fury of battle; had fed him in the wilderness, like
Elijah of old; and restored his wasted strength. He could only
trust to Providence for guidance, and, using his best judgment in
choosing the direction, he entered upon the difficult task of
finding his way out of the woods. He had walked an hour or more,
when, suddenly, three men sprung up in the path before him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Halt! Who comes there?&rdquo; demanded one of them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Friend!&rdquo; replied Tom; though he had a great many
doubts in regard to the truth of his assertion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Advance, friend, and give the countersign!&rdquo;</p>
<p>But the soldier boy had no countersign to give. He had fallen
upon a rebel picket post, and was made a prisoner.</p>
<h3><a id="Ch_15" name="Ch_15">Chapter XV.</a></h3>
<h2>Tom a Prisoner.</h2>
<p class="returnTOC"><a href="#Contents">Return to Table of
Contents</a></p>
<p>Tom could not exactly understand how he happened to be made a
prisoner. He had certainly moved with extreme caution, and he
wondered that he had not received some intimation of the presence
of the enemy before it was too late to retreat. But, as we have
before hinted, Tom was a philosopher; and he did not despair even
under the present reverse of circumstances, though he was greatly
disconcerted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who are you?&rdquo; demanded one of the rebel soldiers,
when they had duly possessed his body, which, however, was not a
very chivalrous adventure, for the prisoner was unarmed, his gun
having been thrown away by the friendly Zouave, after he had so
terribly avenged his murdered companion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m a soldier,&rdquo; replied Tom, greatly
perplexed by the trials of his difficult situation.</p>
<p>As yet he did not know whether he had fallen into the hands of
friend or foe, for the night was cloudy and dark, and he could not
see what uniform the pickets wore.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you belong to?&rdquo; demanded the spokesman of
the picket trio.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I belong to the army,&rdquo; answered Tom, with admirable
simplicity.</p>
<p>Our soldier boy, as the reader already knows, had been well
&ldquo;brought up.&rdquo; He had been taught to tell the truth at
all times; and he did so on the present occasion, very much to the
confusion, no doubt, of the rebel soldiers, who had not been
brought up under the droppings of the sanctuary in a New England
village.</p>
<p>&ldquo;B&rsquo;long to the army&mdash;do you?&rdquo; repeated
Secesh, who must have thought Tom a very candid person.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir, I belong to the army,&rdquo; added the
prisoner.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I s&rsquo;pose you won&rsquo;t mind telling us what army
you belong to, &rsquo;cause it mought make a difference in our
calculations,&rdquo; added the spokesman.</p>
<p>Tom did not know but that it might make some difference in his
calculations, and for this reason he was exceedingly unwilling to
commit himself before he ascertained upon which side his
questioners belonged.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can you tell me where I am?&rdquo; asked Tom, resolved to
use a little strategy in obtaining the desired information.</p>
<p>&ldquo;May be I can,&rdquo; replied the picket.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will you do so?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sartin, stranger&mdash;you are in the woods,&rdquo; added
Secesh; whereat his companions indulged in a wholesome chuckle,
which assured Tom that they were human, and his hopes rose
accordingly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo; replied Tom, with infinite good
nature.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You say you belong to the army, and I say you are in the
woods,&rdquo; said the soldier, repeating the double postulate, so
that the essence of the joke should by no possibility fail to
penetrate the cerebellum of his auditor.</p>
<p>Tom was perfectly willing to acknowledge that he was in the
woods, both actually and metaphorically, and he was very much
disturbed to know how he should get out of the woods&mdash;a
problem which has puzzled wiser heads than his, even in less
perplexing emergencies. He was fearful that, if he declared himself
to be a Union soldier, he should share the fate of others whom he
had seen coolly bayoneted on that eventful day.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, stranger, s&rsquo;pose you tell me what army you
b&rsquo;long to; then I can tell you where you are,&rdquo;
continued the soldier.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you belong to?&rdquo; asked Tom, though he did
not put the question very confidently.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I belong to the army;&rdquo; and the two other pickets
honored the reply with another chuckle. &ldquo;You can&rsquo;t fool
old Alabammy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was no further need of fooling &ldquo;Old Alabammy,&rdquo;
for the worthy old gentleman, symbolically represented by the rebel
soldier, had kindly done it himself; and Tom then realized that he
was in the hands of the enemy. It is true, the balance of the
picket trio laughed heartily at the unfortunate slip of the tongue
made by their companion, but Tom was in no condition to relish the
joke, or he might perhaps have insinuated himself into the good
graces of the jolly Secesh by repeating Pat&rsquo;s mysterious
problem&mdash;&ldquo;Tell me how many cheeses there are in the bag,
and I&rsquo;ll give ye the whole five;&rdquo; for, though this is
an old joke in the civilized parts of the world, it is not at all
probable that it had been perpetrated in the benighted regions of
Secessia.</p>
<p>The announcement of the fact that he was in the hands of the
foe, as we have before intimated, left Tom in no condition to give
or take a joke. His heart was suddenly deprived of some portion of
its ordinary gravity, and rose up to the vicinity of his throat. He
drew sundry deep and long breaths, indicative of his alarm; for
though Tom was a brave boy,&mdash;as these pages have already
demonstrated,&mdash;he had a terrible idea of the tender mercies of
the rebels. His first impulse was to break away from his captors,
and run the risk of being overtaken by a trio of musket balls; for
death from the quick action of a bullet seemed preferable to the
fate which his fears conjured up if he should be taken by the
bloodthirsty rebels. But the chances were too decidedly against
him, and he reluctantly brought his mind to the condition of
philosophical submission.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, stranger, which army do you b&rsquo;long to?&rdquo;
said the spokesman of the picket trio, when he had fully recovered
his self-possession.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I belong to the United States army,&rdquo; replied Tom,
desperately.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That means the Yankee army, I s&rsquo;pose.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir; you call it by that name.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then you are my prisoner.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I surrender because I can&rsquo;t help myself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hev you nary toothpick or bone-cracker in your
pockets?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Any what?&rdquo; replied Tom, whose dictionary seemed to
be at fault.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nary pistol, knife, or any thing of that sort?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing but my jackknife.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Any plunder?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We piled up our knapsacks and haversacks before we went
into the fight. Here is my canteen half full of water; I gave the
other half to one of your soldiers, when he was dying of his
wounds.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did ye?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now will you be kind enough to tell me where I
am?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are inside the lines of our army, about three miles
below Centreville,&rdquo; replied one of the pickets.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What time is it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nigh upon nine o&rsquo;clock, I should say. One of you
fellers must take this prisoner to headquarters,&rdquo; he
continued, speaking to his companions.</p>
<p>Tom was very agreeably surprised to find that his captors did
not propose to hang, shoot, or bayonet him; and the Southern
Confederacy rose a few degrees in his estimation. Certainly the men
who had taken him were not fiends, and he began to hope that his
situation as a prisoner would not be so terrible as his fancy had
pictured it.</p>
<p>One of the men was deputed to conduct him to the officer of the
guard; and he walked along by the side of the soldier through the
woods, in the direction from which he had just come.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can you tell me how the battle went at last?&rdquo; asked
Tom, as they pursued their way through the forest.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We whipped you all to pieces. Your army hasn&rsquo;t done
running yet. We shall take Washington to-morrow, and Jeff Davis
will be in the White House before the week is out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have you taken many prisoners?&rdquo; asked Tom, who
could not dispute the position of the rebel soldier.</p>
<p>&ldquo;About fifty thousand, I b&rsquo;lieve,&rdquo; replied
Secesh, with refreshing confidence.</p>
<p>Tom indulged in a low whistle, but his companion could not tell
whether it was an expression of regret or incredulity. If they had
stood on an equality, Tom would probably have suggested that the
figures should be interpreted &ldquo;over the left&rdquo;&mdash;an
idiosyncrasy in language which he had imported from Pinchbrook, but
which may not be wholly unintelligible to our young readers.</p>
<p>From his conductor he obtained some particulars of the battle
and its result, which were afterwards more fully set forth in
General Beauregard&rsquo;s official report, and which would have
read better on the pages of Sinbad the Sailor than in the folios of
a military despatch. But the Secesh soldier&rsquo;s &ldquo;facts
and figures&rdquo; were comforting to Tom, who still had a stronger
interest in the condition of the good cause, after the heavy blow
it had received, than he had in his own individual welfare. Like
too heavy a dose of poison, the magnitude of the stories refuted
and defeated them. The soldier boy listened in respectful silence,
but he was utterly incredulous. It was even possible that the Union
army had won a victory, after all, though he was not very sanguine
on this point.</p>
<p>He was ultimately conducted to the headquarters of the regiment
to which his captors belonged, and then turned into a lot with
about twenty others, who were strongly guarded. Tom joined his
companions in misery, most of whom, worn out by the fatigues of the
day, were sleeping soundly upon the ground. Only two or three of
them were awake; but these were strangers to him, and he was unable
to obtain any information from them concerning any of his friends
in the regiment.</p>
<p>It began to rain shortly after Tom joined his fellow-prisoners;
but there was no shelter for them. They had neither blankets nor
great coats, yet this did not seem to disturb them. Our soldier boy
threw himself upon the ground, but the nap he had taken under the
side of the log set his eyes wide open for a time. He could only
think of home, his mother and sisters, and John, by this time
snugly coiled away in the bed where he had been wont to dream of
the glories of war. He had cast his fears to the winds when he
found that his captors did not intend to butcher him, and he could
not help thinking that his situation might have been worse.</p>
<p>Those with whom he had spoken told him they had eaten nothing
since morning; and in this respect he was far better off than his
companions were. The only thing that troubled him was the thought
of the anguish which his mother must suffer, when she heard of the
battle. When the regiment should be gathered together again, he
would be reported as &ldquo;missing,&rdquo; and this would be a
terrible word to her, for it meant killed, wounded, or a prisoner.
If he could only assure her that he still lived and was uninjured,
he would have been happy&mdash;happy in spite of the drenching
rain&mdash;happy in spite of the prospective dungeon, and the
hardships to which he might be subjected. He felt that he had
faithfully performed his duty. When he began to be drowsy, he
settled himself in the most comfortable place he could find on the
ground, and thanked God that he had been spared his life through
the perils of that awful day, and more fervently that he had been
enabled to do his duty like a good soldier; and then, with the
Giver of all Good, the Fountain of all Mercy, in his heart, he fell
asleep.</p>
<p>He slept several hours, and waked up to find himself as
thoroughly soaked as though he had just come out of the river.
There was no help for it, and it was no use to grumble. After
walking to and fro for half an hour, he lay down again, and,
between sleeping and waking, finished the night; uncomfortably, it
is true, and yet without any positive suffering. There were
hundreds, if not thousands, who were enduring the agony of fearful
wounds through that long night; who were lying alone and uncared
for where they had fallen in the deadly strife; who were dying
every hour, away from their homes and friends, and with no kind
hand to minister to their necessities, with no sweet voice of a
loved one to smooth their passage down to the dark, cold grave.</p>
<p>Tom thought of these, for he had seen them in his path, and he
felt that he had no cause to complain&mdash;that he ought to be
cheerful and happy. At the dawn of the day he and his
fellow-prisoners were marched to Sudley Church, where they were to
be confined until they could be sent to Richmond. Here Tom found a
captain belonging to his regiment; but neither could give any
information to the other in regard to their friends.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I shall not stay here long,&rdquo; said the captain, in a
whisper, when they had become better acquainted. &ldquo;I intend to
leave to-night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t I go with you?&rdquo; asked Tom.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You can go, but we had better not go together.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tom thought for a while, and determined upon an attempt to
escape. During the day, he carefully examined the premises, and
decided upon his mode of operations.</p>
<h3><a id="Ch_16" name="Ch_16">Chapter XVI.</a></h3>
<h2>A Perplexing Question.</h2>
<p class="returnTOC"><a href="#Contents">Return to Table of
Contents</a></p>
<p>Tom Somers, who had had some experience, in a small way, in the
kind of business now before him, was filled with hope when he had
adopted his plan. He was a resolute and energetic young man, and to
resolve upon any thing was almost equivalent to doing it. There
were a great many difficulties in the way of success, it is true;
but, nothing daunted by these, he determined to persevere. The
church in which the prisoners were confined was carefully guarded
on the exterior, and the sentinels carried loaded muskets in their
hands&mdash;so that the affair before him was more hazardous and
trying than that of escaping from the attic chamber of Squire
Pemberton&rsquo;s house in Pinchbrook.</p>
<p>If he succeeded in making his way out of the church and eluding
the guard which surrounded it, even then his trials would only have
commenced; for there were many miles of hostile country between him
and Washington, whither he supposed the Federal army had been
driven. The captain who intended to escape at the same time gave
him some information which would be of service to him in finding
his way to the Potomac. He charged him particularly to follow the
railroad, which would conduct him to Alexandria, in the vicinity of
which he would probably find the regiment.</p>
<p>At dark the prisoners disposed of themselves as well as they
could for the night. Tom saw the captain go through all the forms
of preparing for a comfortable lodging, and he did the same
himself. For hours he lay ruminating upon his purpose. When it was
midnight, he thought it was time for him to commence the
enterprise. He worked himself along on the floor till he reached
the principal entrance. The door was open, as it had been all day,
to enable the guards to obtain an occasional view of the
prisoners.</p>
<p>The sentinels were evidently in no condition to discharge their
duties with fidelity, for they had been marching and fighting for
two or three days, and were nearly exhausted. Leaning against the
door, Tom discovered a musket, which the careless guard had left
there. On the floor in the entry lay two rebel soldiers. They had
stretched themselves across the threshold of the door, so that no
one could pass in or out of the church without stepping over
them.</p>
<p>Tom carefully rose from his recumbent posture, and took
possession of the musket. Then, with the utmost prudence, he
stepped over the bodies of the sleeping soldiers; but with all his
circumspection, he could not prevent one of his shoes from
squeaking a little, and it required only a particle of noise to
rouse the guard.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who goes there?&rdquo; demanded one of them, springing to
his feet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is this the way you do your duty?&rdquo; replied Tom, as
sternly as though he had been a brigadier general.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who are you?&rdquo; said the soldier, apparently
impressed by the words and the tones of him who reproved his
neglect.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who am I, you sleepy scum! I&rsquo;ll let you know who I
am in about ten minutes,&rdquo; added Tom, as he passed out at the
front door of the church.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Give me back my gun&mdash;won&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; pleaded
the confused sentinel.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll give it back to you at the court-martial which
will sit on your case to-morrow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who goes there?&rdquo; challenged one of the sentinels on
the outside.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who goes there!&rdquo; added Tom, in a sneering tone.
&ldquo;Have you waked up? Where were you five minutes ago, when I
passed this post? There won&rsquo;t be a prisoner left here by
morning. The long roll wouldn&rsquo;t wake up such a stupid set of
fellows.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stop, sir!&rdquo; said the astonished sentinel.
&ldquo;You can&rsquo;t pass this line.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t I, you stupid fool? I have passed it while
you were asleep.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t been asleep.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where have you been, then?&rdquo; demanded Tom with
terrible energy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Been here, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll court-martial the whole of you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stop, sir, or I&rsquo;ll fire at you!&rdquo; added the
soldier, as Tom moved on.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fire at me! Fire, if you dare, and I&rsquo;ll rid the
army of one unfaithful man on the spot!&rdquo; said the soldier
boy, as he raised the musket to his shoulder.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t fire, you fool!&rdquo; interposed one of the
men whom Tom had roused from his slumbers in the entry.
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you see he is an officer?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll teach you how to perform your duty!&rdquo;
added Tom, as he walked away.</p>
<p>The soldier, governed by the advice of his companion, offered no
further objection to the departure of Tom; and he moved off as
coolly as though he had just been regularly relieved from guard
duty. He had walked but a short distance before he discovered the
camp of a regiment or brigade, which, of course, it was necessary
for him to avoid. Leaving the road, he jumped over the fence into a
field&mdash;his first object being to place a respectful distance
between himself and the enemy.</p>
<p>The scene through which he had just passed, though he had
preserved the appearance of coolness and self-possession, had been
exceedingly trying to his nerves; and when the moment of pressing
danger had passed, he found his heart up in his throat, and his
strength almost wasted by the excitement. He felt as one feels when
he has just escaped a peril which menaced him with instant death.
It was singular that the soldier had not fired, but the fact that
he did not convinced Tom that there is an amazing power in
impudence.</p>
<p>For half an hour, he pursued his way with haste and diligence,
but without knowing where he was going&mdash;whether he was moving
toward Richmond or Washington. As the musket which he had taken
from the church was not only an encumbrance, but might betray him,
he threw it away, though, thinking some means of defence might be
useful, he retained the bayonet, and thrust it in his belt. Thus
relieved of his burden, he walked till he came to a road. As there
was no appearance of an enemy in any direction, he followed this
road for some time, and finally it brought him to the object of his
search&mdash;the railroad.</p>
<p>But then came up the most perplexing question he had yet been
called upon to decide. To that railroad, as to all others, there
were, unfortunately, two ends&mdash;one of which lay within the
Federal lines, and the other within the rebel lines. If Tom had
been an astronomer, which he was not, the night was too cloudy to
enable him to consult the stars; besides, some railroads are so
abominably crooked that the heavenly orbs would hardly have been
safe pilots. He did not know which was north, nor which was south,
and to go the wrong way would be to jump out of the frying pan into
the fire.</p>
<p>Tom sat down by the side of the road, and tried to settle the
difficult question; but the more he thought, the more perplexed he
became&mdash;which shows the folly of attempting to reason when
there are no premises to reason from. He was, no doubt, an
excellent logician; but bricks cannot be made without straw.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Which way shall I go?&rdquo; said Tom to himself, as he
stood up and peered first one way and then the other through the
gloom of the night.</p>
<p>But he could not see Washington in one direction, nor Richmond
in the other, and he had not a single landmark to guide him in
coming to a decision.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll toss up!&rdquo; exclaimed he, desperately, as
he took off his cap and threw it up into the air. &ldquo;Right side
up, this way&mdash;wrong side, that way; and may the fates or the
angels turn it in the proper way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He stooped down to pick up the cap, and ascertain which way it
had come down. It came down right side up, and Tom immediately
started off in the direction indicated. Although he had no
confidence in the arbitrament of the cap, he felt relieved to find
the question disposed of even in this doubtful manner.</p>
<p>He kept both eyes wide open as he advanced, for if he had taken
the wrong way a few miles of travel would bring him to the main
camp of the rebels in the vicinity of Manassas Junction. He pursued
his lonely journey for some time without impediment, and without
discovering any camp, either large or small. He gathered new
confidence as he proceeded. After he had walked two or three hours
upon the railroad, he thought it was about time for Fairfax station
to heave in sight, if he had chosen the right way&mdash;or for the
rebel camps to appear if he had chosen the wrong way. With the
first place he was familiar, as his regiment had encamped a short
distance from it.</p>
<p>He was sorely perplexed by the non-appearance of either of these
expected points. The country began to look wilder and less familiar
as he proceeded. The region before him looked rugged and
mountainous, and the dark outlines of several lofty peaks touched
the sky in front of him. But with the feeling that every step he
advanced placed a wider space between him and his captors at Sudley
church, he continued on his way till the gray streaks of daylight
appeared behind him.</p>
<p>This phenomenon promised to afford him a gleam of intelligence
upon which to found a correct solution of his course. Tom knew
that, in the ordinary course of events, the sun ought to rise in
the east and set in the west. If he was going to the north, the sun
would rise on his right hand&mdash;if to the south, on his left
hand. The streaks of light grew more and more distinct, and the
clouds having rolled away, he satisfied himself where the sun would
appear. Contrary to both wings of his theory, the place was neither
on his right nor his left, for it was exactly behind him. But his
position might be upon a bend of the railroad whose direction did
not correspond with the general course of the road. For half an
hour longer, therefore, he pursued his way, carefully noting every
curve, until he was fully convinced that his course was nearer west
than north. The sun rose precisely as had been laid down in the
programme, and precisely where he expected it would rise.</p>
<p>It was clear enough that he was not moving to the south; and,
satisfied that he was in no danger of stumbling upon Richmond, his
courage increased, and he plodded on till he discovered a small
village&mdash;or what would be called such in Virginia&mdash;though
it contained only a few houses. As he still wore the uniform of the
United States army, he did not deem it prudent to pass through this
village; besides, he was terribly perplexed to know what station it
could be, and what had become of Fairfax. Though he must have
passed through the country before, it did not look natural to
him.</p>
<p>Leaving the railroad, he took to the fields, intending to pass
round the village, or conceal himself in the woods till he could go
through it in safety. After walking diligently for so many hours,
Tom was reminded that he had a stomach. His rations on the
preceding day had not been very bountiful, and he was positively
hungry. The organ which had reminded him of its existence was
beginning to be imperative in its demands, and a new problem was
presented for solution&mdash;one which had not before received the
attention which it deserved.</p>
<p>In the fields and forest he found a few berries; but all he
could find made but a slight impression upon the neglected organ.
If Tom was a philosopher, in his humble way, he was reasonable
enough to admit that a man could not live without eating. At this
point, therefore, the question of rations became a serious and
solemn problem; and the longer it remained unsolved the more
difficult and harassing it became.</p>
<p>After he had rested all the forenoon in a secluded spot, without
interruption from man or beast, he decided to settle this question
of rations once for all. If impudence had enabled him to pass a
line of rebel sentries, it ought to furnish him with a dinner.
Leaving his hiding place, he walked till he discovered a small
house, at which he determined to apply for something to eat.</p>
<h3><a id="Ch_17" name="Ch_17">Chapter XVII.</a></h3>
<h2>Dinner and Danger.</h2>
<p class="returnTOC"><a href="#Contents">Return to Table of
Contents</a></p>
<p>The house at which Tom applied for food evidently did not belong
to one of the &ldquo;first families,&rdquo; or, if it did, the
owner&rsquo;s fortunes had become sadly dilapidated. It was built
of rough boards, with a huge stone chimney, which was erected on
the outside of the structure. The humblest fisherman in Pinchbrook
Harbor would have thought himself poorly accommodated in such a
rough and rickety mansion.</p>
<p>If Tom&rsquo;s case had not been growing desperate, he would not
have run the risk of showing himself to any person on the
&ldquo;sacred soil&rdquo; who was &ldquo;to the manor born;&rdquo;
but his stomach was becoming more and more imperative in its
demands, and he knocked at the front door with many misgivings,
especially as his exchequer contained less than a dollar of clear
cash.</p>
<p>The inmates were either very deaf or very much indisposed to see
visitors; and Tom, after he had knocked three times, began to think
he had not run any great risk in coming to this house. As nobody
replied to his summons, he took the liberty to open the door and
enter. The establishment was even more primitive in its interior
than its exterior, and the soldier boy could not help contrasting
it with the neat houses of the poor in his native town.</p>
<p>The front door opened into a large room without the formality of
an entry or hall. In one corner of the apartment stood a bed. At
one side was a large fireplace, in which half a dozen sticks of
green wood were hissing and sizzling in a vain attempt to make the
contents of an iron pot, which hung over them, reach the boiling
point. No person was to be seen or heard on the premises, though
the fire and the pot were suggestive of humanity at no great
distance from the spot.</p>
<p>A door on the back side of the room was open, and Tom looked out
in search of the occupants of the house. In the garden he
discovered the whole family, consisting of a man and his wife, a
girl of twelve, and a boy of ten. The man was digging in the
garden, and the rest of the troupe seemed to be superintending the
operation. The head of the family was altogether the most
interesting person to Tom, for he must either shake hands or fight
with him. He did not look like a giant in intellect, and he
certainly was not a giant in stature. With the bayonet still in his
belt, Tom was not afraid of him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How are you, people?&rdquo; said Tom, as he walked
towards the family, who with one accord suspended all operations,
and gave their whole attention to the stranger.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How are ye, yourself?&rdquo; replied the man, rather
gruffly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you keep a hotel?&rdquo; demanded Tom, who concealed
the anxiety of his heart under a broad grin.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I reckon I don&rsquo;t. What do you want here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I want something to eat,&rdquo; replied Tom, proceeding
to business with commendable straight-forwardness.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We hain&rsquo;t got nothin&rsquo; here,&rdquo; said the
man, sourly. &ldquo;That ain&rsquo;t what ye come fur,
nuther.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Must have something to eat. I&rsquo;m not very
particular, but I must have something.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You can&rsquo;t hev it &rsquo;bout yere, no how. That
ain&rsquo;t what ye come fur, nuther.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you know what I came for better than I do, suppose you
tell me what it is,&rdquo; added Tom, who was a little mystified by
the manner of the man.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You air one of them soger fellers, and you want me to
&rsquo;list; but I tell yer, ye can&rsquo;t do nothin&rsquo; of the
sort. I&rsquo;ll be dog derned if I&rsquo;ll go.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want you to go,&rdquo; protested Tom.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m half starved and all I want is something to
eat.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yer don&rsquo;t reelly mean so.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where d&rsquo;yer come from?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;From down below here. Have you seen any soldiers pass
through this place?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I reckon I hev; but they hain&rsquo;t seen me; and I
reckon they won&rsquo;t see me very soon;&rdquo; and the man
chuckled at his own cleverness in keeping clear of recruiting
officers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want you, and if you will give me something
to eat, you will get rid of me very quick.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Betsey, you kin feed the feller, if yer like, and
I&rsquo;ll go over and see whar the hogs is.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The man dropped his shovel, and began to move off towards the
woods, probably to see whether Tom would attempt to detain him. At
the same time &ldquo;Betsey&rdquo; led the way into the house, and
the visitor paid no further attention to the master.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We hain&rsquo;t got much to eat in the house,&rdquo; said
the woman, as they entered the room. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s some
biled pork and pertaters in the pot, and we&rsquo;ve got some
bread, sech as &rsquo;tis.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It will do me very well. I&rsquo;m hungry, and can eat
any thing,&rdquo; replied Tom.</p>
<p>The woman placed a tin plate on the table, and dished up the
contents of the kettle on the fire. She added some cold hoe cake to
the dinner, and Tom thought it was a feast fit for a king. He took
a seat at the table, and made himself entirely at home. The food
was coarse, but it was good, and the hungry soldier boy did ample
justice to the viands. The boy and girl who had followed him into
the house, stood, one on each side of him, watching him in
speechless astonishment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where did yer come from?&rdquo; asked the woman, when Tom
had about half finished his dinner.</p>
<p>&ldquo;From down below,&rdquo; replied Tom, rather
indefinitely.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t b&rsquo;long in these yere parts, I
reckon?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, marm.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where are ye gwine?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Going to join my regiment.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where is yer rigiment?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s more than I know, marm.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How long yer been travelling?&rdquo; persisted the woman,
who was perhaps afraid that the guest would eat up the whole of the
family&rsquo;s dinner, if she did not make some kind of a feint to
attract his attention.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Only a few days, marm.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Kin yer till me what all thet noise was about day
&rsquo;fore yesterday?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, marm; it was a big battle.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gracious me! Yer don&rsquo;t say so! Whar was
it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Down below Centreville.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Which beat?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Confederates drove the Yankees off the field,&rdquo;
answered Tom, suspending business long enough to glance at the
woman, and see how the intelligence was received.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yer don&rsquo;t! Then they won&rsquo;t want my old
man.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tom was unable to determine whether his hostess was Union or
&ldquo;Secesh&rdquo; from her words or her looks. He could not
inform her whether they would want her old man or not. When he had
eaten all he could, he proposed like an honest youth to pay for
what he had eaten; but Betsey had the true idea of southern
hospitality, and refused to receive money for the food eaten
beneath her roof. She had a loaf of coarse bread, however, in which
she permitted Tom to invest the sum of six cents.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am very much obliged to you, marm; and I shall be glad
to do as much for you, any time,&rdquo; said Tom, as he went
towards the front door.</p>
<p>As he was about to open it, his ears were startled by an
imperative knock on the outside. He stepped back to one of the two
windows on the front of the house, where he discovered an officer
and two &ldquo;grayback&rdquo; soldiers. The ghost of his
grandmother would not have been half so appalling a sight, and he
retreated to the back door with a very undignified haste.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gracious me!&rdquo; exclaimed the lady of the house.
&ldquo;Who kin thet be?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;An officer and two soldiers,&rdquo; replied Tom,
hastily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then they are arter my old man!&rdquo; said she, dropping
into the only chair the room contained.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t say I&rsquo;m here, marm, and I&rsquo;ll help
your husband, if they catch him. Tell them he has gone off to be
absent a week.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;d be absent more&rsquo;n thet if he knowed them
fellers was arter him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The woman moved towards the front door, and Tom through the back
door; but as he was about to pass into the garden, he caught a
glimpse of one of the graybacks in the rear of the house. For a
moment his case seemed to be hopeless; but he retreated into the
room again, just as the woman opened the front door to admit the
officer. He could not escape from the house, and his only resource
was to secure a hiding place within its walls. There were only two
which seemed to be available; one of these was the bed, and the
other the chimney. If any search was made, of course the soldiers
would explore the bed first; and the chimney seemed the most
practicable.</p>
<p>There was no time for consideration, for the woman had already
opened the door, and was answering the questions of the Confederate
officer; so Tom sprang into the fireplace, and, by the aid of the
projecting stones, climbed up to a secure position. The chimney was
large enough to accommodate half a dozen boys of Tom&rsquo;s size.
The fire had gone out, and though the stones were rather warm in
the fireplace, he was not uncomfortable.</p>
<p>The fears of the lady of the house proved to be well grounded
this time, for the party had actually come in search of her
&ldquo;old man;&rdquo; and what was more, the officer announced his
intention not to leave without him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s gone away fur a week, and he won&rsquo;t be
hum before the fust of August, no how,&rdquo; said the woman
resolutely, and adopting Tom&rsquo;s suggestion to the letter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All nonsense, woman! He is about here, somewhere, and we
will find him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You may, if you kin.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The officer then went out at the back door, as Tom judged by his
footsteps, and the woman asked one of the children what had become
of the other soldier man. The boy said he was up chimney. She then
told them not to tell the officer where he was.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What shell I do?&rdquo; said she, placing herself before
the fireplace.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be alarmed. He will keep out of their
way,&rdquo; replied Tom.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But the officer man said he was gwine to stay &rsquo;bout
yere till he gits hum,&rdquo; moaned the poor woman.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He will not do any such thing. Your husband has the woods
before him, and he won&rsquo;t let them catch him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Deary me! I&rsquo;m &rsquo;feared they will.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where are they now?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;re gone out to look for him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The officer and his men returned in a few moments, having
satisfied themselves that the proprietor of the place was not on
the premises.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now we&rsquo;ll search the house,&rdquo; said the
officer; and Tom heard them walking about in the room.</p>
<p>Of course the militia man could not be found, and the officer
used some very unbecoming language to express his disapprobation of
the skulker, as he called him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Woman, if you don&rsquo;t tell me where your husband is,
I&rsquo;ll have you arrested,&rdquo; said he, angrily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know myself. He&rsquo;s gone off over the
mountains to git some things. Thet&rsquo;s all I know about it, and
if yer want to arrest me, yer kin.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But the officer concluded that she would be a poor substitute
for an able bodied man, and he compromised the matter by leaving
one of the privates, instructing him not to let the woman or the
children leave the house, and to remain till the skulker
returned.</p>
<p>This was not very pleasant information for Tom who perceived
that he was likely to be shut up in the chimney for the rest of the
day, and perhaps be smoked or roasted out at supper time. Climbing
up to the top of his prison house, he looked over, and saw the
officer and one private disappear in the woods which lay between
the house and the railroad. Looking over the other way, he saw the
coveted recruit approaching the house from beyond the garden.</p>

<h2>The Rebel Soldier.</h2>
<p class="returnTOC"><a href="#Contents">Return to Table of
Contents</a></p>
<p>Tom Somers was not very well satisfied with his situation, for
the soldier who had been left in possession of the house was armed
with a musket, and the prospect of escaping before night was not
very flattering. The patriarch of the family, who had such a horror
of recruiting officers, was approaching, and in a few moments there
would be an exciting scene in the vicinity.</p>
<p>Independent of his promise made to the woman to help her
husband, if she would not betray him, Tom deemed it his duty to
prevent the so-called Confederate States of America from obtaining
even a single additional recruit for the armies of rebellion and
treason. Without having any personal feeling in the matter,
therefore, he was disposed to do all he could to assist his host in
&ldquo;avoiding the draft.&rdquo; What would have been treason in
New England was loyalty in Virginia.</p>
<p>The unfortunate subject of the Virginia militia law was
unconsciously approaching the trap which had been set for him. He
had, no doubt, come to the conclusion, by this time, that the
hungry soldier boy was not a recruiting officer, or even the
corporal of a guard sent to apprehend him, and he was returning
with confidence to partake of his noonday meal. Tom, from his perch
at the top of the chimney, watched him as he ambled along over the
rough path with his eyes fixed upon the ground. There was something
rather exciting in the situation of affairs, and he soon found
himself deeply interested in the issue.</p>
<p>The unhappy citizen owing service to the Confederate States
climbed over the zigzag fence that enclosed his garden, and
continued to approach the rude dwelling which the law had defined
to be his castle. Tom did not dare to speak in tones loud enough to
be heard by the innocent victim of the officer&rsquo;s conspiracy,
for they would have betrayed his presence to the enemy. Sitting
upon the top stones of the chimney, he gesticulated violently,
hoping to attract his attention; but the man did not look up, and
consequently could not see the signals.</p>
<p>He had approached within ten rods of the back door of the house,
when Tom, fearing his footsteps might attract the attention of the
soldier, ventured to give a low whistle. As this was not heeded, he
repeated the signal when the man was within two or three rods of
the house; but even this was not noticed, and throwing his head
forward, so that the sound of his voice should not descend the
chimney, he spoke.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Halloo!&rdquo; said he.</p>
<p>The man suddenly stopped, and looked up. Tom made signals with
his hands for him to leave; but this mute language appeared not to
be intelligible to him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Consarn yer picter, what are yer doin&rsquo; up
thar?&rdquo; said the proprietor of the castle, in tones which
seemed to Tom as loud as the roar of the cannon at Bull Run.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hush! Hush!&rdquo; replied Tom, gesticulating with all
his might, and using all his ingenuity to invent signs that would
convey to the militiaman the idea that he was in imminent
danger.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You be scotched!&rdquo; snarled the man. &ldquo;What are
yer doin&rsquo;? What ails yer?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They are after you!&rdquo; added Tom, in a hoarse
whisper.</p>
<p>The fellow most provokingly refused to hear him, and Tom thought
his skull was amazingly thick, and his perceptions amazingly
blunt.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now you come down from thar,&rdquo; said he, as he picked
up a couple of stones. &ldquo;You act like a monkey, and I
s&rsquo;pose yer be one. Now make tracks down that
chimley.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But instead of doing this, Tom retreated into his shell, as a
snail does when the moment of peril arrives. The soldier in the
house was not deaf; and if he had been, he could hardly have helped
hearing the stentorian tones of his victim. Instead of going out
the back door, like a sensible man, he passed out at the front
door, and in a moment more Tom heard his voice just beneath
him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Halt!&rdquo; shouted the soldier, as he brought his
musket to his shoulder. &ldquo;Your name is Joe Burnap.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s my name, but I don&rsquo;t want
nothin&rsquo; o&rsquo; you,&rdquo; replied the embarrassed
militiaman, as he dropped the stones with which he had intended to
assault Tom&rsquo;s citadel.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I want something of you,&rdquo; replied the soldier.
&ldquo;You must go with me. Advance, and give yourself
up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What fur?&rdquo; asked poor Joe.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We want you for the army. You are an enrolled militiaman.
You must go with me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ill be dog derned if I do,&rdquo; answered Joe Burnap,
desperately.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you attempt to run away, I&rsquo;ll shoot you. You
shall go with me, dead or alive, and hang me if I care much
which.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Joe evidently did care. He did not want to go with the soldier;
his southern blood had not been fired by the wrongs of his country;
and he was equally averse to being shot in cold blood by this
minion of the Confederacy. His position was exceedingly
embarrassing, for he could neither run, fight, nor compromise.
While matters were in this interesting and critical condition, Tom
ventured to raise his head over the top of the chimney to obtain a
better view of the belligerents. Joe stood where he had last seen
him, and the soldier was standing within three feet of the foot of
the chimney.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What ye going to do, Joe Burnap?&rdquo; demanded the
latter, after waiting a reasonable time for the other to make up
his mind.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What am I gwine to do?&rdquo; repeated Joe, vacantly, as
he glanced to the right and the left, apparently in the hope of
obtaining some suggestion that would enable him to decide the
momentous question.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You needn&rsquo;t look round, Joe; you&rsquo;ve got to
come or be shot. Just take your choice between the two, and
don&rsquo;t waste my time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I s&rsquo;pose I can&rsquo;t help myself,&rdquo; replied
Joe. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell ye what I&rsquo;ll do. I want to fix up
things about hum a little, and I&rsquo;ll jine ye down to the Gap
to-morrow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No you don&rsquo;t, Joe Burnap!&rdquo; said the soldier,
shaking his head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then I&rsquo;ll jine ye to-night,&rdquo; suggested the
strategist.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My orders are not to return without you, and I shall obey
them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Burnap, who had followed the soldier out of the house,
stood behind him wringing her hands in an agony of grief. She
protested with all a woman&rsquo;s eloquence against the
proceedings of the soldier; but her tears and her homely rhetoric
were equally unavailing. While the parties were confronting each
other, the soldier dropped his piece, and listened to the arguments
of Joe and his wife. When he turned for a moment to listen to the
appeals of the woman, her husband improved the opportunity to
commence a retreat. He moved off steadily for a few paces, when the
enemy discovered the retrograde march, and again brought the gun to
his shoulder.</p>
<p>&ldquo;None of that, Joe,&rdquo; said the soldier, sternly.
&ldquo;Now march back again, or I&rsquo;ll shoot you;&rdquo; and
Tom heard the click of the hammer as he cocked the piece.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve fooled long enough with you, and we&rsquo;ll end
this business here. Come here, at once, or I&rsquo;ll put a bullet
through your head.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t shoot! Don&rsquo;t shoot! For mercy&rsquo;s
sake don&rsquo;t shoot,&rdquo; cried Mrs. Burnap.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll give him one minute to obey the order; if he
don&rsquo;t do it then, I&rsquo;ll fire. That&rsquo;s all
I&rsquo;ve got to say.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tom saw by the soldier&rsquo;s manner that he intended to
execute his threat. He saw him brace up his nerves, and otherwise
prepare himself for the bloody deed. But Tom did not think that Joe
had the stubbornness or the courage, whichever it might be called,
to run the risk of dodging the bullet. He foresaw, too, that, if
Joe gave himself up, his hiding place would be exposed, and the
soldier would have two prisoners to conduct back to his officer,
instead of one. It was therefore high time for him to do something
for his own protection, if not for that of his host.</p>
<p>The necessity of defending himself, or of doing something to
cover his retreat in an emergency, had been anticipated by Tom, and
he had made such preparations as the circumstances would admit. His
first suggestion was to dart his bayonet down at the rebel soldier,
as he had seen the fishermen of Pinchbrook harpoon a horse
mackerel; but the chances of hitting the mark were too uncertain to
permit him to risk the loss of his only weapon, and he rejected the
plan. He adopted the method, however, in a modified, form, deciding
to use the material of which the chimney was constructed, instead
of the bayonet. The stones being laid in clay instead of mortar,
were easily detached from the structure, and he had one in his
hands ready for operations.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come here, Joe Burnap, or you are a dead man,&rdquo;
repeated the soldier, who evidently had some scruples about
depriving the infant Confederacy of an able-bodied recruit.</p>
<p>Tom Somers, being unembarrassed by any such scruples, lifted
himself up from his hiding place, and hurled the stone upon the
soldier, fully expecting to hit him on the head, and dash out his
brains. The best laid calculations often miscarry, and Tom&rsquo;s
did in part, for the missile, instead of striking the soldier upon
the head, hit him on the right arm. The musket was discharged,
either by the blow or by the act of its owner, and fell out of his
hands upon the ground.</p>
<p>Now, a stone as big as a man&rsquo;s head, does not fall from
the height of fifteen feet upon any vulnerable part of the human
frame without inflicting some injury; and in strict conformity with
this doctrine of probabilities, the stone which Tom hurled down
upon the rebel, and which struck him upon the right arm, entirely
disabled that useful member. The hero of this achievement was
satisfied with the result, though it had not realized his
anticipations. Concluding that the time had arrived for an
effective charge, he leaped out of the chimney upon the roof of the
house, descended to the eaves, and then jumped down upon the
ground.</p>
<p>The soldier, in panic and pain, had not yet recovered from the
surprise occasioned by this sudden and unexpected onslaught. Tom
rushed up to him, and secured the musket before he had time to
regain his self-possession.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who are you?&rdquo; demanded the soldier, holding up the
injured arm with his left hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your most obedient servant,&rdquo; replied Tom,
facetiously, as he placed himself in the attitude of &ldquo;charge
bayonets.&rdquo; &ldquo;Have you any dangerous weapons about your
person?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I have,&rdquo; replied the soldier, resolutely, as
he retreated a few steps, and attempted to thrust his left hand
into the breast pocket of his coat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hands down!&rdquo; exclaimed Tom, pricking his arm with
the bayonet attached to the musket. &ldquo;Here, Joe
Burnap!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What d&rsquo; yer want?&rdquo; replied the proprietor of
the house, who was as completely &ldquo;demoralized&rdquo; by the
scene as the rebel soldier himself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Put your hand into this man&rsquo;s pocket, and take out
his pistol. If he resists, I&rsquo;ll punch him with this,&rdquo;
added Tom, demonstrating the movement by a few vigorous thrusts
with the bayonet.</p>
<p>With some hesitation Joe took a revolver from the pocket of the
soldier, and handed it to Tom.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Examine all his pockets. Take out everything he has in
them,&rdquo; added Tom, cocking the revolver, and pointing it at
the head of the prisoner.</p>
<p>Joe took from the pockets of the rebel a quantity of pistol
cartridges, a knife, some letters, and a wallet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who&rsquo;s this fur?&rdquo; asked Joe, as he proceeded
to open the wallet, and take therefrom a roll of Confederate
&ldquo;shin-plasters.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Give it back to him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But this is money.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Money!&rdquo; sneered Tom. &ldquo;A northern beggar
wouldn&rsquo;t thank you for all he could carry of it. Give it back
to him, and every thing else except the cartridges.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Joe reluctantly restored the wallet, the letters, and the knife,
to the pockets from which he had taken them. Tom then directed him
to secure the cartridge box of the soldier.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are my prisoner,&rdquo; said Tom; &ldquo;but I
believe in treating prisoners well. You may go into the house, and
if your arm is much hurt, Mrs. Burnap may do what she can to help
you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The prisoner sullenly attended the woman into the house, and Tom
followed as far as the front door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, what am I gwine to do?&rdquo; said Joe.
&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve got me into a right smart scrape.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thought I had got you out of one,&rdquo; replied Tom.
&ldquo;Do you intend to remain here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sartin not, now. I must clear.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So must I; and we have no time to spare. Get what you can
to eat, and come along.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In ten minutes more, Tom and Joe Burnap were travelling towards
the mountains.</p>
<h3><a id="Ch_19" name="Ch_19">Chapter XIX.</a></h3>
<h2>Through the Gap.</h2>
<p class="returnTOC"><a href="#Contents">Return to Table of
Contents</a></p>
<p>Joe Burnap was perfectly familiar with the country, and Tom
readily accepted him as a guide; and, as they had a common object
in view, neither had good cause for mistrusting the other. They
walked, without stopping to rest, till the sun set behind the
mountains towards which they were travelling.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I reckon we needn&rsquo;t hurry now,&rdquo; said Joe, as
he seated himself on a rock.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think there is any danger of their catching
us,&rdquo; replied Tom, as he seated himself beside his
fellow-traveller. &ldquo;Can you tell me where we are?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I reckon I can. There ain&rsquo;t a foot of land in these
yere parts that I hain&rsquo;t had my foot on. I&rsquo;ve toted
plunder of all sorts through these woods more&rsquo;n ten thousand
times.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, where are we?&rdquo; asked Tom, whose doubts in
regard to the locality had not yet been solved.</p>
<p>In the pressure of more exciting matters, he had not attempted
to explain why he did not come to Fairfax station while following
the railroad.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If we keep on a little while longer, I reckon we shall
come to Thoroughfare Gap,&rdquo; answered Joe.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But where do you live? What town is your house in?&rdquo;
asked Tom, who had never heard of Thoroughfare Gap before.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Haymarket is the nearest town to my house.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What railroad is that over there?&rdquo; asked Tom, who
was no nearer the solution of the question than he had been in the
beginning.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the Manassas Gap Railroad, I reckon,&rdquo;
replied Joe, who seemed to be astonished at the ignorance of his
companion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just so,&rdquo; added Tom, who now, for the first time,
comprehended where he was.</p>
<p>When he left Sudley church, he walked at random till he came to
the railroad; but he had struck the Manassas Gap Railroad instead
of the main line, and it had led him away from the great body of
the rebels, though it also conducted him away from Washington,
where he desired to go. He was perplexed at the discovery, and at
once began to debate the question whether it was advisable for him
to proceed any farther in this direction.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose you are a Union man&mdash;ain&rsquo;t
you?&rdquo; said Tom, after he had considered his situation for
some time.</p>
<p>Instead of answering this question, Joe Burnap raised his eyes
from the ground, and fixed his gaze intently upon Tom. He stared at
him for a moment in doubt and silence, and then resumed his former
attitude.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t want to fight for the south,&rdquo; added
Tom; &ldquo;so I suppose you don&rsquo;t believe in the Southern
Confederacy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to fight for nuther of
&rsquo;em,&rdquo; replied Joe, after a moment of further
consideration. &ldquo;If they&rsquo;ll only let me alone, I
don&rsquo;t keer which beats.&rdquo;</p>
<p>His position was certainly an independent one, and he appeared
to be entirely impartial. The newspapers on either side would not
have disturbed him. Patriotism&mdash;love of country&mdash;had not
found a resting place in his soul. Tom had not, from the beginning,
entertained a very high respect for the man; but now he despised
him, and thought that a rebel was a gentleman compared with such a
character. How a man could live in the United States, and not feel
an interest in the stirring events which were transpiring around
him, was beyond his comprehension. In one word, he so thoroughly
despised Joe Burnap, that he resolved, at the first convenient
opportunity, to get rid of him, for he did not feel safe in the
company of such a person.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now which side do you fight fur?&rdquo; asked Joe, after
a long period of silence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;For the Union side,&rdquo; replied Tom, promptly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What are yer doin&rsquo; here, then?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was in the battle below, and was taken prisoner, got
away, and I want to get to Washington.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I reckon this ain&rsquo;t the way to git thar,&rdquo;
added Joe.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I doubt whether I can get there any other way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Just then, Tom would have given all the money he had in the
world, and all that the government owed him, for a good map of
Virginia&mdash;or even for a knowledge of geography which would
have enabled him to find his way by the safest route to Washington.
But he had been a diligent scholar in school, and had faithfully
improved the limited opportunities which had been afforded him. His
mind could recall the map of Virginia which he had studied in
school, but the picture was too faint to be of much practical
benefit to him.</p>
<p>He had treasured up some information, derived from the
newspapers, in regard to the Manassas Gap Railroad. He knew that it
passed through the Blue Ridge, at the western base of which flowed
the Shenandoah River: this emptied into the Potomac, which would
certainly conduct him to Washington. In following these two rivers,
he should have to describe nearly a circle, which was not an
encouraging fact to a boy on foot, with no resources, and in an
enemy&rsquo;s country.</p>
<p>If he returned by the way he came, the country was filled with
rebel soldiers, and he could hardly expect to pass through their
lines without being captured. Difficult and dangerous as the route
by the Shenandoah appeared, he decided to adopt it.</p>
<p>Joe Burnap proposed that they should have supper and opened the
bag which he had filled with such eatables as he could hastily
procure on leaving home. They ate a hearty meal, and then resumed
their walk for another hour.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I reckon we&rsquo;d better stop here,&rdquo; said Joe.
&ldquo;The Gap&rsquo;s only half a mile from here, and it&rsquo;s
too arly in the night to go through thar yet. Thar&rsquo;s too many
soldiers goin&rsquo; that way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What time will you go through?&rdquo; asked Tom.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not afore midnight.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then I&rsquo;ll turn in and take a nap. I didn&rsquo;t
sleep any last night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m agreed,&rdquo; replied Joe, who seemed to be
indifferent to every thing while he could keep out of the rebel
army.</p>
<p>Tom coiled up his body in the softest place he could find, and
went to sleep. Exhausted by fatigue and the want of rest, he did
not wake for many hours. He came to his senses with a start, and
jumped upon his feet. For a moment, he could not think where he
was; but then came the recollection that he was in the country of
his enemies&mdash;a wanderer and a fugitive.</p>
<p>He looked about him in search of his travelling companion; but
the fact that he could not see him in the night was no argument
that he was not near him. He supposed Joe had chosen a place to
sleep in the vicinity, and thinking he might not wake in season to
pass through the Gap before daylight, he commenced a search for
him. He beat about the place for half an hour, calling his
companion by name; but he could not see him, and no sound responded
to the call but the echoes of his own voice.</p>
<p>The independent Virginia farmer had anticipated Tom&rsquo;s
intention to part company with him, and, by this time, perhaps, had
passed through the Gap. The soldier boy was not quite ready to
dispense with the services of his guide, inasmuch as he did not
even know where the Gap was, or in what direction he must travel to
reach it. While he was debating his prospects, an enterprising
rooster, in the distance, sounded his morning call. This assured
him that he must be near some travelled road, and, taking the
direction from the fowl, he resumed his journey.</p>
<p>A short walk brought him out of the woods, and, in the gray
light of the dawn, he discovered a house. As he did not care to
make any new acquaintances, he avoided the house, and continued his
travels till he arrived at a road. As it was too early in the
morning for people to be stirring, he ventured to follow the
highway, and soon perceived an opening in the mountains, which he
doubted not was the Gap.</p>
<p>At sunrise he arrived at another house, which suddenly came into
view as he rounded a bend in the road. Near it were several negroes
engaged in various occupations. As he passed the house, the negroes
all suspended operations, and stared at him till he was out of
sight. He soon reached the Gap; but he had advanced only a short
distance before he discovered a battery of light artillery
stationed on a kind of bluff, and whose guns commanded the
approaches in every direction.</p>
<p>Deeming it prudent to reconnoitre before he proceeded any
farther, he also ascertained that the Gap was picketed by rebel
infantry. Of course it was impossible to pass through under these
circumstances, and he again took to the woods. The scanty supply of
food which he had purchased from Mrs. Burnap was now produced, and
he made an economical breakfast. Finding a secluded place, he
stretched himself upon the ground, and went to sleep. Though he
slept till the sun had passed the meridian, the day was a very long
one.</p>
<p>When it was fairly dark, he resolved to attempt the passage of
the Gap, for he was so tired of inaction that peril and hardship
seemed preferable to doing nothing. Returning to the road, he
pursued his way with due diligence through the narrowing defile of
the mountains, till he suddenly came upon a sentinel, who
challenged him. Before he started from his hiding place, Tom had
carefully loaded the revolver which he had taken from the rebel
soldier; and, as he walked along, he carried the weapon in his
hand, ready for any emergency that might require its use.</p>
<p>The guard questioned him, and Tom replied that he had fought in
the battle down below, and had a furlough to go home and see his
father, who was very sick.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where&rsquo;s your furlough?&rdquo; demanded the
soldier.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In my pocket.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let me see it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here it is,&rdquo; replied Tom, producing an old letter
which he happened to have in his pocket.</p>
<p>The sentinel took the paper, unfolded it, and turned it over two
or three times. It was too dark for him to read it if he had been
able to do so, for all the rebel soldiers are not gifted in this
way.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I reckon this won&rsquo;t do,&rdquo; he added, after
patiently considering the matter. &ldquo;Just you tote this paper
up to the corporal thar, and if he says it&rsquo;s all right, you
kin go on.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I can&rsquo;t stop to do all that. Here&rsquo;s my
pass, and I want to go on. My father may die before I get
home.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What regiment do you b&rsquo;long to?&rdquo; asked the
guard, who evidently did not wish to disoblige a fellow-soldier
unnecessarily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Second Virginia,&rdquo; replied Tom, at a
venture.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where does your father live?&rdquo; continued the
sentinel.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just beyond the Gap, if he&rsquo;s living at
all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What town?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tom was nonplussed, for he did not know the name of a single
place on the route before him; and, of course, he did not dare to
answer the question.</p>
<p>&ldquo;About five or six miles from here,&rdquo; he
answered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is it Salem or White Plains?&rdquo; demanded the soldier,
whose cunning was inferior to his honesty.</p>
<p>&ldquo;White Plains,&rdquo; added Tom, promptly accepting the
suggestion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter with your father?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know; he was taken suddenly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pears like your uniform ain&rsquo;t exactly our
sort,&rdquo; added the soldier.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mine was all used up, and I got one on the
battle-field.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t do that. It&rsquo;s mean to rob a dead
man of his clothes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Couldn&rsquo;t help it&mdash;I was almost naked,&rdquo;
replied Tom, who perfectly agreed with the rebel on this point.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You kin go on, Old Virginny,&rdquo; said the soldier,
whose kindly sympathy for Tom and his sick father was highly
commendable.</p>
<p>The soldier boy thanked the sentinel for his permission, of
which he immediately availed himself. Tom did not yet realize the
force of the maxim that &ldquo;all is fair in war,&rdquo; and his
conscience gave a momentary twinge as he thought of the deception
he had practised upon the honest and kind-hearted rebel. He was
very thankful that he had not been compelled to put a bullet
through his head; but perhaps he was more thankful that the man had
not been obliged to do him a similar favor.</p>
<p>The fugitive walked, with an occasional rest, till daylight the
next morning. He went through three or four small villages. After
passing through the Gap, he had taken the railroad, as less likely
to lead him through the more thickly settled parts of the country.
Before him the mountains of the Blue Ridge rose like an impassable
wall, and when the day dawned he was approaching Manassas Gap. He
had walked twenty-five miles during the night, and prudence, as
well as fatigue, required him to seek a place of rest.</p>

<h2>Down the Shenandoah.</h2>
<p class="returnTOC"><a href="#Contents">Return to Table of

<p>In that wild mountain region, Tom had no difficulty in finding a
secluded spot, where there was no probability that he would be
molested. He had been in a state of constant excitement during the
night, for the country was full of soldiers. The mountaineers of
Virginia were rushing to the standard of rebellion. They were a
wild, rude set of men, and they made the night hideous with their
debauchery. Tom succeeded in keeping out of the way of the
straggling parties which were roaming here and there; but he was
filled with dread and anxiety lest he should, at the next moment,
stumble upon a camp, or a squad of these marauders.</p>
<p>The nook in the mountains which he had chosen as his resting
place was a cleft in the rocks, concealed by the overhanging
branches of trees. Here he made his bed, as the sun rose, and, worn
out with fatigue and anxiety, he dropped asleep.</p>
<p>When he awoke, the sun was near the meridian. He rose and walked
out a short distance from his lodging place, and listened for any
sounds which might indicate the presence of an enemy. All was
still; silence deep and profound reigned through the solitudes of
the mountains. Tom returned to his place of concealment, and after
eating the remainder of the food he had brought with him, he
stretched himself upon the ground, and went to sleep again. He had
nothing else to do, and he needed all the rest he could obtain. It
was fortunate for him that he had self-possession enough to
sleep&mdash;to banish his nervous doubts and fears, and thus secure
the repose which was indispensable to the success of his arduous
enterprise.</p>
<p>It was after sundown when he finished his second nap. He had
slept nearly all day,&mdash;at least ten hours,&mdash;and he was
entirely refreshed and restored. He was rather stiff in some of his
limbs when he got up; but he knew this would wear off after a
little exercise. He had no supper with which to brace himself for
the night&rsquo;s work; so he took a drink from the mountain
stream, and made his way back to the railroad. But it was too early
then to commence the passage of the Gap, and he sat for a couple of
hours by the side of the road, before he ventured to resume his
journey.</p>
<p>While he was passing through the narrow gorge in the mountains,
he met several persons, on foot and on horseback; but as he was
armed with a pistol, he did not turn out for them; but when a party
of soldiers approached, he sought a hiding place by the side of the
road until they were out of hearing. When he had passed through the
Gap, he came to a road crossing the track, and after debating the
question thoroughly, he decided to abandon the railroad, and
pursued his course by the common highway towards the North.</p>
<p>Continuing his journey diligently for a time longer, he came to
another road, branching off to the left from the one he had chosen,
which required further consideration. But his conclusion was
satisfactory, and he continued on the same road, which soon brought
him to a more thickly settled country than that through which he
had been travelling.</p>
<p>By this time Tom&rsquo;s stomach began to be rebellious again,
and the question of rations began to assume a serious aspect. He
was not suffering for food, but it was so much more comfortable to
travel upon a full stomach than an empty one, that he could not
pass a dwelling house without thinking of the contents of the
cellar and closets. It was perfectly proper to forage on the enemy;
but he could not eat raw chicken and geese, or the problem of
rations would have been effectually settled by a demonstration on
the hen-coops of the Shenandoah valley.</p>
<p>He came to a halt before a large mansion, which had the
appearance of belonging to a wealthy person. Its larder and kitchen
cupboards, he doubted not, were plentifully supplied with the
luxuries of the season; and Tom thought he might as well obtain his
provisions now, as wait till he was driven to desperation by
hunger. He entered the front gate of the great house, and stepped
upon the veranda in front of it. The windows reached down to the
floor. He tried one of them, and found that it was not fastened. He
carefully raised the sash and entered.</p>
<p>Tom was determined to put himself upon his impudence on the
present occasion; but he satisfied himself that his revolver was in
condition for instant use before he proceeded any farther. Passing
from the front room to an apartment in the rear, he found a lamp
and matches, and concluded that he would have some light on the
subject, which was duly obtained. Leaving this room, he entered
another, which proved to be the kitchen. A patient search revealed
to him the lurking place of a cold roast chicken, some fried bacon,
bread, and crackers.</p>
<p>Placing these things on the table, he seated himself to partake
of the feast which the forethought of the occupants had provided
for him. Tom began to be entirely at home, for having thrown
himself on his impudence now; he did not permit any doubts or fears
to disturb him; but the handle of his pistol protruded from between
the buttons of his coat. He ate till he had satisfied himself, when
he happened to think that the coffee pot he had seen in the closet
might contain some cold coffee; and he brought it out. He was not
disappointed, and even found sugar and milk. He poured out a bowl
of the beverage, and, having prepared it to his taste, was about to
conclude the feast in this genteel style, when he heard footsteps
in the adjoining entry.</p>
<p>Tom determined not to be cheated out of his coffee, and instead
of putting himself in a flurry, he took the bowl in one hand and
the pistol in the other. The door opened, and a negro timidly
entered the room.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, sar!&rdquo; said the servant, as he edged along the
side of the room. &ldquo;Hem! Well, sar!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tom took no notice of him, but continued to drink his coffee as
coolly as though he had been in his mother&rsquo;s cottage at
Pinchbrook.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hem! Well, sar!&rdquo; repeated the negro, who evidently
wished to have the interloper take some notice of him.</p>
<p>But the soldier boy refused to descend from his dignity or his
impudence. He finished the bowl of coffee as deliberately as though
the darkey had been somewhere else.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, sar! Who&rsquo;s you, sar?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Eh, Blackee?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who&rsquo;s you, sar?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good chicken! Good bread! Good bacon!&rdquo; added Tom.
&ldquo;Are the folks at home, Blackee?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, sar; nobody but de women folks, sar. Who&rsquo;s you,
sar?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It don&rsquo;t make much difference who I am.
Where&rsquo;s your master?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gone to Richmond, sar. He&rsquo;s member ob
Congress.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then he&rsquo;s in poor business, Blackee,&rdquo; said
Tom, as he took out his handkerchief, and proceeded to transfer the
remnants of his supper to its capacious folds.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Better luff dem tings alone, sar.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But Tom refused to &ldquo;luff dem alone,&rdquo; and when he had
placed them on the handkerchief, he made a bundle of them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Golly, sar! I&rsquo;ll tell my missus what&rsquo;s gwine
on down here,&rdquo; added the servant, as he moved towards the
door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;See here, Blackee,&rdquo; interposed Tom, pointing his
pistol at the negro; &ldquo;if you move, I&rsquo;ll put one of
these balls through your skull.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;De Lud sabe us, massa! Don&rsquo;t shoot dis nigger,
massa.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hold your tongue then, and mind what I say.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, massa,&rdquo; whined the darkey, in the most abject
tones.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now come with me, Blackee, and if you open your mouth,
one of these pills shall go down your throat.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tom flourished his pistol before the negro, and led the way to
the window by which he had entered the house. Passing out upon the
veranda, he cautiously conducted the terrified servant to the road;
and when they had gone a short distance, he halted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, Blackee, what town is this?&rdquo; demanded Tom.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Leeds Manor, sar,&rdquo; replied the trembling negro.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How far is it to the Shenandoah River?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Only two or tree miles, massa. Now let dis chile go home
again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not yet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hab mercy on dis nigger dis time, and sabe
him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I won&rsquo;t hurt you, if you behave
yourself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tom questioned him for some time in regard to the river, and the
towns upon its banks; and when he had obtained all the information
in regard to the valley which the servant possessed, he resumed his
journey, driving the negro before him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Spare dis chile, massa, for de sake ob de wife and
chil&rsquo;n,&rdquo; pleaded the unwilling guide.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I tell you I won&rsquo;t hurt you if you behave
yourself,&rdquo; replied Tom. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll have the whole
place down upon me in half an hour, if I let you go now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, massa; dis nigger won&rsquo;t say one word
&rsquo;bout you, nor de tings you took from de house&mdash;not one
word, massa. Spare dis chile, and luff him go home.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But Tom compelled him to walk before him till they came to the
river. The place was called Seaburn&rsquo;s Ford.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, Blackee, if anybody wants me, tell them I&rsquo;ve
gone to Winchester,&rdquo; said Tom, when he had ordered his escort
to halt.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, massa, I won&rsquo;t say one word,&rdquo; replied the
servant.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you do, I&rsquo;ll shoot you the very next time I see
you&mdash;depend upon that. You can go now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The negro was not slow to avail himself of this privilege, and
ran off, evidently expecting a bullet from the revolver would
overtake him before he had gone far, for he glanced fearfully over
his shoulder, begging his captor not to shoot him.</p>
<p>Tom stood upon the bank of the Shenandoah. The negro had told
him that he was about thirty miles from Harper&rsquo;s Ferry, which
he knew was in possession of General Patterson&rsquo;s forces.
Attached to a tree on the shore was a small flat-bottomed boat,
which attracted the attention of the soldier boy. Tom was
accustomed to boats, and the sight of this one suggested a change
of programme, for it would be much easier to float down the stream,
than to walk the thirty miles. This was a point which needed no
argument; and unfastening the painter of the boat, he jumped in,
and pushed off. Seating himself in the stern, with the paddle in
his hand, he kept her head with the current, and swept down the
rapid stream like a dreamy youth just starting upon the voyage of
life.</p>
<p>Like the pilgrim on the sea of time, Tom was not familiar with
the navigation of the Shenandoah, and he had neither chart nor
compass to assist him. The current was very swift, and once in a
while the bateau bumped upon a concealed rock, or bar of sand.
Fortunately no serious accident occurred to him, though he found
that the labor of managing the boat was scarcely less than that of
walking.</p>
<p>There was one consolation about it; he was in no danger of
missing the road, and he was not bothered by Confederate soldiers
or inquisitive civilians. His light bark rushed on its way down the
stream, without attracting the notice of any of the inhabitants, if
any were abroad at that unseemly hour of the night. The
difficulties of the navigation were overcome with more or less
labor, and when the day dawned, Tom made up his mind that he had
done a good night&rsquo;s work; and choosing a secluded nook by the
side of the river, he hauled up his boat, intending to wait for the
return of darkness.</p>
<p>The place he had chosen appeared to be far from any habitation,
and he ate his breakfast in a very hopeful frame of mind. Though he
was not very tired or very sleepy, yet for the want of something
better to do, he felt compelled to go to sleep, hoping, as on the
previous day, to dispose of the weary hours in this agreeable
manner. His pastime, however, was soon interrupted by loud shouts
and the tramp of men, not far from the spot where he lay. A hurried
examination of the surroundings assured him that he had chosen a
resting place near one of the fords of the river, over which a
rebel regiment was then passing.</p>
<h3><a id="Ch_21" name="Ch_21">Chapter XXI.</a></h3>
<h2>The Problem of Rations.</h2>
<p class="returnTOC"><a href="#Contents">Return to Table of
Contents</a></p>
<p>The ford over which the rebel regiment was passing was only a
few rods distant from the place where Tom had concealed himself and
his boat. When he discovered the soldiers, he was thrilled with
terror; and, fully believing that his hour had come, he dropped
upon the ground, to wait, in trembling anxiety, the passage of the
troops. It was a regiment of Virginia mountaineers, clothed in the
most fantastic style with hunting-shirts and coon-skin caps. They
yelled and howled like so many wildcats.</p>
<p>From his hiding place on the bank of the stream, he obtained a
good view of the men, as they waded across the river. He was
fearful that some of them might stray from the ranks, and stumble
upon his place of refuge; but a kind Providence put it into their
heads to mind their own business, and Tom gathered hope as the
yells of the mountaineers grew indistinct in the distance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is no place for me,&rdquo; said Tom to himself, when
the sounds had died away in the direction of the Blue Ridge.
&ldquo;A whole army of them may camp near that ford, and drive me
out of my hiding place.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jumping into the bateau again, he waited till he was satisfied
no carriage or body of troops was in the vicinity; and then plying
the paddle with the utmost vigor, he passed the ford. But then he
found that the public highway ran along the banks of the river,
which exposed him to increased risk of being seen. A couple of
vehicles passed along the road while he was in this exposed
situation; but as the occupants of them seemed to take no notice of
him, he congratulated himself upon his escape, for presently the
boat was beneath the shadows of the great trees. Finding a suitable
place, he again hauled up, and concealed himself and the
bateau.</p>
<p>As all danger seemed to have passed, Tom composed his nerves,
ate his dinner, and went to sleep as usual; but his rest was not so
tranquil as he had enjoyed in the solitudes of the mountains.
Visions of rebel soldiers haunted his dreams, and more than once he
started up, and gazed wildly around him; but these were only
visions, and there was something more real to disturb his
slumbers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hi! Who are you?&rdquo; exclaimed a wildcat soldier, who
had penetrated the thicket without disturbing the sleeper.</p>
<p>Tom started up, and sprang to his feet. One of the tall
mountaineers, whom he had seen crossing the ford, stood before him;
and the reality was even more appalling than the vision.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who mought you be?&rdquo; demanded the tall soldier, with
a good-natured grin upon his greasy face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Faith! I believe I&rsquo;ve been asleep!&rdquo; said Tom,
rubbing his eyes, and looking as innocent as a young lamb.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You may bet your life on thet, my boy,&rdquo; replied the
rebel, laughing. &ldquo;Hi! Jarvey!&rdquo; added he, apparently
addressing a companion at no great distance from the spot.</p>
<p>Heavy footsteps announced the approach of Jarvey, who soon
joined them. He was not less than six feet three inches in height,
and, with two such customers as these, Tom had no hope except in
successful strategy. He had no doubt they had obtained information
of him from the persons in the vehicles, and had come to secure
him. He fully expected to be marched off to the rebel regiment,
which could not be far off.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who is he, Sid?&rdquo; asked Jarvey, when he reached the
spot.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dunno. Say, who are ye, stranger?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who am I? Tom Somers, of course. Do you belong to that
regiment that stopped over yonder last night?&rdquo; asked Tom,
with a proper degree of enthusiasm. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you know
me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, we don&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t you see me over there? That&rsquo;s a bully
regiment of yours. I&rsquo;d like to join it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Would you, though, sonny?&rdquo; said Sid, laughing till
his mouth opened wide enough for a railroad train to pass in.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wouldn&rsquo;t I, though!&rdquo; replied Tom. &ldquo;If
there&rsquo;s any big fighting done, I&rsquo;ll bet your boys do
it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bet your life on thet,&rdquo; added Jarvey. &ldquo;But
why don&rsquo;t you jine a regiment?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t want to join any regiment that comes along. I
want to go into a fighting regiment, like yours.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, sonny, you ain&rsquo;t big enough to jine
ours,&rdquo; said Sid, as he compassionately eyed the young
man&rsquo;s diminutive proportions.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The old man wouldn&rsquo;t let me go in when I wanted to,
and I&rsquo;m bound not to go in any of your fancy regiments. I
want to fight when I go.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll do, sonny. Now, what ye doing
here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I came out a-fishing, but I got tired, and went to
sleep.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where&rsquo;s your fish-line?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In the boat.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What ye got in that handkerchief?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My dinner,&rdquo; replied Tom. &ldquo;Won&rsquo;t you
take a bite?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What ye got?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A piece of cold chicken and some bread.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We don&rsquo;t mind it now, sonny. Hev you seen any men
with this gear on in these yere parts?&rdquo; asked Jarvey, as he
pointed to his uniform.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, <em>sir</em>,&rdquo; replied Tom, vigorously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whar d&rsquo;ye see &rsquo;em, sonny?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They crossed the ford, just above, only a little while
ago.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How many?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Two,&rdquo; replied Tom, with promptness.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where&rsquo;s the other?&rdquo; asked Jarvey, turning to
his companion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s in these yere woods, somewhar. We&rsquo;ll
fotch &rsquo;em before night. You say the two men crossed the
ford&mdash;did ye, sonny?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, half an hour ago. What is the matter with
them?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;re mean trash, and want to run off. Now,
sonny, &rsquo;spose you put us over the river in your
boat.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, <em>sir</em>!&rdquo; replied Tom, readily.</p>
<p>The two wildcats got into the bateau, nearly swamping it by
their great weight, and Tom soon landed them on the other side of
the river.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank&rsquo;e, sonny,&rdquo; said Jarvey, as they jumped
on shore. &ldquo;If you were only four foot higher, we&rsquo;d like
to take you into our regiment. You&rsquo;ll make a right smart
chance of a soldier one of these yere days. Good by,
sonny.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good by,&rdquo; answered Tom, as he drew a long breath,
indicative of his satisfaction at being so well rid of his
passengers.</p>
<p>He had fully persuaded himself that he should be carried off a
prisoner to this wildcat regiment, and he could hardly believe his
senses when he found himself again safely floating down the rapid
tide of the Shenandoah. His impudence and his self-possession had
saved him; but it was a mystery to him that his uniform, or the
absence of his fish-line, or the answers he gave, had not betrayed
him. The mountaineers had probably not yet seen a United States
uniform, or they would, at least, have questioned him about his
dress.</p>
<p>Tom ran down the river a short distance farther before he
ventured to stop again, for he could not hope to meet with many
rebel soldiers who were so innocent and inexperienced as these
wildcats of the mountains had been. When the darkness favored his
movements, he again embarked upon his voyage. Twice during the
night his boat got aground, and once he was pitched into the river
by striking upon a rock; but he escaped these and other perils of
the navigation with nothing worse than a thorough ducking, which
was by no means a new experience to the soldier boy. In the
morning, well satisfied with his night&rsquo;s work, he laid up for
the day in the safest place he could find.</p>
<p>On the second day of his voyage down the river, the old problem
of rations again presented itself for consideration, for the ham
and chicken he had procured at Leed&rsquo;s Manor were all gone.
There were plenty of houses on the banks of the river, but Tom had
hoped to complete his cruise without the necessity of again
exposing himself to the peril of being captured while foraging for
the commissary department. But the question was as imperative as it
had been several times before, and twelve hours fasting gave him
only a faint hint of what his necessities might compel him to
endure in twenty-four or forty-eight hours. He did not consider it
wise to postpone the settlement of the problem till he was actually
suffering for the want of food.</p>
<p>On the third night of his voyage, therefore, he hauled up the
bateau at a convenient place, and started off upon a foraging
expedition, intending to visit some farmer&rsquo;s kitchen, and
help himself, as he had done on a former occasion. Of course, Tom
had no idea where he was; but he hoped and believed that he should
soon reach Harper&rsquo;s Ferry.</p>
<p>After making his way through the woods for half a mile, he came
to a public road, which he followed till it brought him to a house.
It was evidently the abode of a thrifty farmer, for near it were
half a dozen negro houses. As the dwelling had no long windows in
front, Tom was obliged to approach the place by a flank and rear
movement; but the back door was locked. He tried the windows, and
they were fastened. While he was reconnoitring the premises, he
heard heavy footsteps within. Returning to the door, he knocked
vigorously for admission.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who&rsquo;s thar?&rdquo; said a man, as he threw the door
wide open.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A stranger, who wants something to eat,&rdquo; replied
Tom, boldly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who are ye?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My name is Tom Somers,&rdquo; added the soldier boy, as
he stepped into the house. &ldquo;Can you tell me whether the
Seventh Georgia Regiment is down this way?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I reckon &rsquo;tis; least wise I don&rsquo;t know.
There&rsquo;s three rigiments about five mile below
yere.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was told my regiment was down this way, and I&rsquo;m
trying to find it. I&rsquo;m half starved. Will you give me
something to eat?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sartin, stranger; I&rsquo;ll do thet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The man, who was evidently the proprietor of the house, brought
up the remnant of a boiled ham, a loaf of white bread, some butter,
and a pitcher of milk. Tom ate till he was satisfied. The farmer,
in deference to his amazing appetite probably, suspended his
questions till the guest began to show some signs of satiety, when
he pressed him again as vigorously as though he had been born and
brought up among the hills of New England.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where d&rsquo;ye come from?&rdquo; said he.</p>
<p>&ldquo;From Manassas. I lost my regiment in the fight; and the
next day I heard they had been toted over this way, and I put after
them right smart,&rdquo; answered Tom, adopting as much of the
Georgia vernacular as his knowledge would permit.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Walk all the way?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No; I came in the keers most of the way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you don&rsquo;t wear our colors,&rdquo; added the
farmer, glancing at Tom&rsquo;s clothes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My clothes were all worn out, and I helped myself to the
best suit I could find on the field.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What regiment did ye say ye b&rsquo;longed to?&rdquo;
queried the man, eying the uniform again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;To the Seventh Georgia. Perhaps you can tell me where I
shall find it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t; but I reckon there&rsquo;s somebody here
that can. I&rsquo;ll call him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tom was not at all particular about obtaining this information.
There was evidently some military man in the house, who would
expose him if he remained any longer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who is it, father?&rdquo; asked a person who had probably
heard a part of the conversation we have narrated; for the voice
proceeded from a bed-room adjoining the apartment in which Tom had
eaten his supper.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A soldier b&rsquo;longing to the Seventh Georgia,&rdquo;
answered the farmer. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s my son; he&rsquo;s a
captain in the cavalry, and he&rsquo;ll know all about it. He can
tell you where yer regiment is,&rdquo; added he, turning to Tom,
who was edging towards the door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m very much obliged to you for my supper,&rdquo;
said the fugitive, nervously. &ldquo;I reckon I&rsquo;ll be moving
along.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wait half a second, and my son will tell you just where
to find your regiment.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Seventh Georgia?&rdquo; said the captain of cavalry,
entering the room at this moment with nothing but his pants on.
&ldquo;There&rsquo;s no such regiment up here, and hasn&rsquo;t
been. I reckon you&rsquo;re a deserter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, <em>sir!</em> I scorn the charge,&rdquo; replied Tom,
with becoming indignation. &ldquo;I never desert my
colors.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose not,&rdquo; added the officer, glancing at his
uniform; &ldquo;but your colors desert you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tom failed to appreciate the wit of the reply, and backed off
towards the door, with one hand upon the stock of his revolver.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hold on to him, father; don&rsquo;t let him go,&rdquo;
said the officer, as he rushed back into his chamber, evidently for
his pistols or his sabre.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hands off, or you are a dead man;&rdquo; cried Tom, as he
pointed his revolver at the head of the farmer.</p>
<p>In another instant, the captain of cavalry reappeared with a
pistol in each hand. A stunning report resounded through the house,
and Tom heard a bullet whistle by his head.</p>

<p class="returnTOC"><a href="#Contents">Return to Table of

<p>It was sufficiently obvious to Tom that, on the present
occasion, the suspicions of his host were awakened. It is possible
that, if he had depended upon his impudence, he might have
succeeded in deceiving the Confederate officer; but his evident
intention to retire from the contest before an investigation could
be had, proved him, in the estimation of the captain, to be either
a spy or a deserter, and shooting him was preferable to losing
him.</p>
<p>The officer fired quick, and with little attention to the
important matter of a steady aim; and Tom had to thank his stars
for the hasty shot, for, though it went within a few inches of his
head, &ldquo;a miss was as good as a mile,&rdquo; and the brains of
our hero remained intact and complete. But he was not willing to be
the subject of any further experiments of this description, and
without waiting further to express his gratitude to the host for
the bountiful supper he had eaten, he threw open the door, and
dashed off at the top of his speed.</p>
<p>The revolver he carried was a very good implement with which to
bully a negro, or an unarmed farmer; but Tom had more confidence in
his legs than in his skill as a marksman, and before the captain
could transfer the second pistol from his left to his right hand,
he had passed out of the house, and was concealed from his pursuers
by the gloom of the night. He felt that he had had a narrow escape,
and he was not disposed to trifle with destiny by loitering in the
vicinity of the house.</p>
<p>He had not proceeded far before he heard a hue and cry behind
him; and if the captain of cavalry had not stopped to put on his
boots, it is more than possible that our humble volume might have
contained a chapter or two upon prison life in Richmond.
Undoubtedly it was quite proper for the officer to put on his boots
before he went out; a decent regard for his individual sanitary
condition, and a reasonable horror of ague and rheumatism, would
have induced him to do it, even at the risk of losing a Federal
prisoner, or a rebel deserter, as the case might be. At any rate,
if Tom had known the cause of the delay, he would freely have
forgiven him for wasting his time in healthful precautions.</p>
<p>The fugitive retraced his steps to the river by the same route
he had taken in approaching the hospitable roof of the farmer. As
nearly as he could judge by the sounds that reached him from the
distance, the officer and his father were gathering up a force to
hunt down the fugitive. Tom jumped into the bateau, and pushed off.
Keeping under the shadow of the bank of the river, he plied his
paddle vigorously, and by the time his pursuers arrived at the
river, he was a couple of miles from the spot. He could hear a
shout occasionally in the deep silence of the night, but with the
distance between him and the enemy, he felt entirely secure. The
danger had passed, and he floated leisurely on his voyage, buoyant
as his light bark, and hopeful as the dream of youth.</p>
<p>Hour after hour, in the gloom of the solemn night, he was borne
by the swift tide towards the lines of the loyal army. The day was
dawning, and he was on the lookout for a suitable place to conceal
himself, until the friendly shades of night should again favor his
movements. After the experience of the former night near the ford,
he was very cautious in the selection of a hiding place. It is not
always safe to be fastidious; for while Tom was rejecting one
location, and waiting for another to appear, the river bore him
into a tract of very open country, which was less favorable than
that through which he had just been passing.</p>
<p>The prospect began to make him nervous; and while he was
bitterly regretting that he had not moored the boat before, he was
startled to hear a sharp, commanding voice on the bank at his
left.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who comes there? Halt!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tom looked up, and discovered a grayback, standing on the shore,
very deliberately pointing his musket at him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who comes there?&rdquo; demanded the picket; for at this
point were stationed the outposts of the rebel force in the
Shenandoah valley.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Friend!&rdquo; replied Tom.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Halt, then!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I would, if I could,&rdquo; answered Tom, as hastily as
possible.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Halt, or I&rsquo;ll fire!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I tell you I can&rsquo;t halt,&rdquo; replied Tom, using
his paddle vigorously, as though he was trying to urge the bateau
to the shore. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t fire! For mercy&rsquo;s sake,
don&rsquo;t fire.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tom appeared to be intensely frightened at the situation in
which he was placed, and redoubled his efforts apparently to gain
the bank of the stream; but the more he seemed to paddle one way,
the more the boat went the other way. However much Tom appeared to
be terrified by the peril that menaced him, it must be confessed
that he was not wholly unmoved.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stop your boat, quick!&rdquo; said the soldier, who had
partially dropped his musket from its menacing position.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t stop it,&rdquo; responded Tom, apparently
in an agony of terror. &ldquo;I would go ashore if I
could.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The water runs so swift, I can&rsquo;t stop her; been
trying this two hours.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You will be inside the Yankee lines in half an hour if
you don&rsquo;t fetch to,&rdquo; shouted the picket.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gracious!&rdquo; exclaimed Tom, redoubling his
efforts.</p>
<p>But it was useless to struggle with the furious current, and Tom
threw himself into the bottom of the boat, as if in utter
desperation. If Niagara Falls, with their thundering roar and
fearful abyss, had been before him, his agony could not have been
more intense, as judged from the shore.</p>
<p>By this time, the sentinel on the bank had been joined by his
two companions, and the three men forming the picket post stood
gazing at him, as he abandoned himself to the awful fate of being
captured by the blood-thirsty Yankees, to whose lines the
relentless current of the Shenandoah was bearing him.</p>
<p>When Tom was first challenged by the grayback, the boat had been
some twenty rods above him; and it had now passed the spot where he
stood, but the rebels were still near enough to converse with him.
Tom heard one of them ask another who he was. Of course neither of
them knew who he was, or where he came from.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Try again!&rdquo; shouted one of the pickets. &ldquo;The
Yankees will have you in a few minutes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tom did make another ineffectual effort to check the progress of
the bateau, and again abandoned the attempt in despair. The rebels
followed him on the bank, encouraging him with words of cheer, and
with dire prophecies of his fate if he fell into the hands of the
cruel Yankees.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t you help me?&rdquo; pleaded Tom, in accents
of despair. &ldquo;Throw me a rope! Do something for me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Now, this was a suggestion that had not before occurred to the
picket guard, and Tom would have been infinitely wiser if he had
not put the idea of assisting him into their dull brains; for it is
not at all probable that they would have thought of such a thing
themselves, for the south, especially the poor white trash, are not
largely endowed with inventive genius.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Save me! Save me!&rdquo; cried Tom, as he saw the rebels
engaged in a hasty consultation, the result of which was, that two
of them started off upon the run in a direction at right angles
with the stream.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Try again! Stick to it!&rdquo; shouted the picket left on
the shore.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t do any more; I&rsquo;m all tired
out,&rdquo; replied Tom, throwing himself for the fourth time in
the bottom of the boat, the very picture of despair.</p>
<p>The picture was very much exaggerated and over-drawn; but as
long as the bullet from the rebel&rsquo;s musket did not come his
way, Tom was satisfied with his acting, and hopeful for the future.
The man on the shore, full of sympathy for the distressed and
exhausted voyager, walked and ran so as to keep up with the
refractory barge, which seemed to be spitefully hurling its
agonized passenger into the Federal lines, where death and dungeons
lurked at every corner.</p>
<p>While this exciting drama was in progress, the stream bore Tom
to a sharp bend in the river, where the current set in close to the
shore. His attentive guardian on the bank ran ahead, and stationed
himself at this point, ready to afford any assistance to the
disconsolate navigator which the circumstances might permit.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now&rsquo;s your chance!&rdquo; shouted he. &ldquo;Gosh
all whittaker! put in now, and do your pootiest!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tom adopted this friendly advice, and &ldquo;put in&rdquo; with
all his might; but the more he &ldquo;put in,&rdquo; the more he
put out&mdash;from the shore, whither the inauspicious eddies were
sweeping him. If Tom had not been born in Pinchbrook, and had a
home by the sea, where boating is an appreciated accomplishment, he
would probably have been borne into the arms of the expectant
rebel, or received in his vitals the ounce of cold lead which that
gentleman&rsquo;s musket contained. As it was, he had the skill to
do what he seemed not to be doing. Mr. Johnny Reb evidently did not
suspect that Tom was &ldquo;playing &rsquo;possum,&rdquo; as the
Tennessee sharpshooters would have expressed it. The
voyager&rsquo;s efforts appeared to be made in good faith; and
certainly he applied himself with a degree of zeal and energy which
ought to have overcome the inertia of a small gunboat.</p>
<p>The bateau approached the point not more than a rod from the
waiting arms of the sympathizing grayback. As it passed, he waded a
short distance into the water, and stretched forth his musket to
the unhappy voyager. Tom threw down his paddle, and sprang with
desperate energy to obtain a hold upon the gun. He even succeeded
in grasping the end of the bayonet. For a moment he pulled so hard
that it was doubtful whether the bateau would be hauled ashore, or
Secesh drawn into the deep water.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hold on tight, my boy! Pull for your life!&rdquo; shouted
the soldier, highly excited by the probable success of his
philanthropic efforts.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Save me! Save me!&rdquo; groaned Tom, as he tugged, or
seemed to do so, at the bayonet.</p>
<p>Then, while the united exertions of the saver and the saved, in
anticipation, were on the very point of being successful, the
polished steel of the bayonet unaccountably slipped through the
fingers of Tom, and the bateau was borne off towards the opposite
shore.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Save me! Save me,&rdquo; cried Tom again, in tones more
piteous than ever.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What d&rsquo;ye let go fur?&rdquo; said the grayback,
indignantly, as his musket, which he had held by the tip end of the
stock, dropped into the water, when Tom let go of the bayonet.</p>
<p>The soldier indulged in a volley of peculiarly southern oaths,
with which we cannot disfigure our page, even in deference to the
necessity of painting a correct picture of the scene we have
described. Tom had a vein of humor in his composition, which has
already displayed itself in some of the rough experiences of his
career; and when he saw the rebel soldier deprived of all power to
make war upon him, either offensive or defensive, he could not
resist the temptation to celebrate the signal strategical victory
he had obtained over the picket guard. This triumphal demonstration
was not very dignified, nor, under the circumstances, very prudent
or sensible. It consisted in placing the thumb of his right hand
upon the end of his nose, while he wiggled the four remaining
digital appendages of the same member in the most aggravating
manner, whistling Yankee Doodle as an accompaniment to the
movement.</p>
<p>If Secesh did not understand the case before, he did now; and
fishing up his musket, he emptied the water out of the barrel, and
attempted to fire it. Luckily for Tom, the gun would not go off,
and he swept on his way jubilant and joyous.</p>

<h2>The End of the Voyage.</h2>
<p class="returnTOC"><a href="#Contents">Return to Table of
Contents</a></p>
<p>Tom Somers&rsquo;s voyage down the Shenandoah was, in many
respects, a type of human life. He experienced the various
reverses, the trials and hardships, which attend all sojourners
here below. He triumphed over all obstacles, and when he had
completely outwitted the grayback who had labored so diligently to
save him from his impending fate, he was at the zenith of
prosperity. He had vanquished the last impediment, and the lines of
the Union army&mdash;the haven of peace to him&mdash;were only a
short distance from the scene of his victory.</p>
<p>Prosperity makes men arrogant and reckless, and I am sorry to
say that it had the same effect upon Tom Somers. If he had been
content modestly to enjoy the victory he had achieved, it would
have been wiser and safer for him; but when Fortune was kind to
him, he mocked her, and she turned against him.</p>
<p>When he had passed out of the reach of the rebel soldier, whose
musket had been rendered useless for the time being, Tom believed
that he was safe, and that he had fairly escaped from the last
peril that menaced him on the voyage. But he was mistaken; for as
the current swept the bateau around the bend of the river, he
discovered, to his astonishment and chagrin, the two secesh
soldiers, who had left the picket post some time before, standing
at convenient distances from each other and from the shore, in the
water, ready to rescue him from the fate before him. The place they
had chosen was evidently a ford of the river, where they intended
to check the boat in its mad career down the stream. They were
painfully persistent in their kind intentions to save him from the
horrible Yankees, and Tom wished they had been less humane and less
enthusiastic in his cause.</p>
<p>As soon as Tom perceived this trap, he regretted his imprudence
in betraying himself to the soldier from whom he had just escaped.
His sorrow was not diminished, when, a few minutes later, he heard
the shouts of the third soldier, who, by hard running across the
fields, had reached the ford before him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shoot him! Shoot him! He&rsquo;s a Yankee!&rdquo;
bellowed the grayback on the shore.</p>
<p>Tom was appalled at these words, and wondered how the soldier
could have found out that he was a Yankee; but when he recalled the
fact that he had entertained him with Yankee Doodle at their last
meeting, the mystery became less formidable.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shoot him! He&rsquo;s a Yankee!&rdquo; shouted Secesh on
the bank of the stream.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve left our guns on shore,&rdquo; replied Secesh
in the water.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m very much obliged to you for that,&rdquo; said
Tom to himself, as he grasped his paddle, and set the boat over
towards the right bank of the river.</p>
<p>No doubt the rebels in the water, when they saw with what
facility the boatman moved the bateau in the swift tide, as
compared with his futile efforts farther up the stream, were fully
satisfied of the truth of their companion&rsquo;s assertion. Tom
decided to run the gauntlet between the right bank and the soldier
nearest to that shore. He paddled the bateau with all his vigor,
until he had obtained the desired position.</p>
<p>The graybacks in the water, realizing that they were engaged on
an errand of peace and humanity, had left their muskets on shore.
They were, therefore, comparatively harmless; but the one on shore
had reached the ford, and picking up one of the muskets of his
companions, without threat or warning, fired. It was lucky for Tom
that he was not a Tennessee sharpshooter, nor a Texas ranger, for
the shot passed harmlessly over him. The soldier dropped the gun,
and picked up the other, which he instantly discharged, and with
better aim than before, for the ball struck the bateau, though not
within four feet of where Tom stood.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t waste your powder, if you can&rsquo;t shoot
better than that,&rdquo; shouted one of the soldiers in the water.
&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll hit us next.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stop him, then! Stop him!&rdquo; replied the grayback on
the shore. &ldquo;Kill him if you can.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tom was paddling with all his might to pass the ford before the
soldier nearest to him should reach a position in which he could
intercept the boat. The rebel was an enterprising fellow, and the
soldier boy&rsquo;s chances were growing amazingly small. Secesh
had actually reached a place where he could make a dash at the
boat. There he stood with a long bowie-knife between his teeth, and
with both hands outstretched, ready to seize upon the unfortunate
bark. He looked grim and ferocious, and Tom saw that he was
thoroughly in earnest.</p>
<p>It was a trying situation for a boy of Tom&rsquo;s years, and he
would fain have dodged the issue. That bowie-knife had a wicked
look, though it was mild and tame compared with the savage eye of
the rebel who held it. As it was a case of life and death, the
fugitive braced himself up to meet the shock. Taking his position
in the stern of the boat, he held the paddle in his left hand,
while his right firmly grasped his revolver. It was either
&ldquo;kill or be killed,&rdquo; and Tom was not so sentimental as
to choose the latter rather than the former, especially as his
intended victim was a secessionist and a rebel.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Keep off, or you are a dead man,&rdquo; shouted Tom, as
he flourished his pistol so that his assailant could obtain a fair
view of its calibre, and in the hope that the fellow would be
willing to adopt a politician&rsquo;s expedient, and compromise the
matter by retiring out of range.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tew kin play at that game. This yere tooth-pick will wipe
you out,&rdquo; coolly replied the fellow, as he made a spring at
the boat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stand off!&rdquo; screamed Tom, as he raised the pistol,
and fired.</p>
<p>It was a short range, and Tom would have been inexcusable if he
had missed his aim. The rebel struck his chest with his right hand,
and the bowie knife dropped from his teeth; but with his left hand
he had grasped the gunwale of the boat, and as he sunk down in the
shallow water, he pulled the bateau over on one side till the water
poured in, and threatened to swamp her. Fortunately the wounded man
relaxed his hold, the boat righted, and Tom commenced paddling
again with all his strength and skill.</p>
<p>The other soldier in the water, as soon as he discovered where
Tom intended to pass, hastened over to assist his associate. The
shouts of their companion on shore had fully fired their southern
hearts, and both of them were ten times as zealous to kill or
capture a Yankee, as they had been to save a Virginian. When the
wounded man clutched the boat, the other was not more than ten feet
from him, but farther down the stream. His associate fell, and he
sprang forward to engage in the affray.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stand off, or you are a dead man!&rdquo; yelled Tom, with
emphasis, as he plied his paddle with renewed energy, for he saw
that the man could not reach him.</p>
<p>The bateau passed them both, and Tom began to breathe easier.
The second rebel, finding he could not capture or kill the detested
Yankee, went to the assistance of his companion. The soldier boy
suspended his exertions, for the danger seemed to be over, and
gazed with interest upon the scene which was transpiring in the
water just above him. He was anxious to know whether he had killed
the rebel or not. There was something awful in the circumstances,
for the soldier boy&rsquo;s sensibilities were too acute to permit
him to take a human life, though it was that of an enemy, without
producing a deep impression upon his mind. Perhaps, in the great
battle in which he had been a participant, he had killed several
rebels; if he had done so, he had not seen them fall. This was the
first man he had consciously killed or wounded, and the fact was
solemn, if not appalling, to the young soldier.</p>
<p>As the rebel raised his companion from the water he seemed to be
dead, and Tom was forced to the conclusion that he had killed him.
He had done the deed in self-defence, and in the strict line of
duty. He could not be blamed even by his enemies for the act. He
felt no exultation, and hoped from the bottom of his heart that the
man was prepared to meet his Maker, into whose presence he had been
so suddenly summoned.</p>
<p>Tom had heard the boys in Pinchbrook talk lightly about killing
rebels, and he had talked so himself; but the reality was not so
pleasant as it had seemed at a distance. He was sorry for the poor
fellow, and wished he had not been obliged to kill him. It was
terrible to him, even in battle, to take a human life, to slay a
being created in the image of God, and for whom Christ lived and
died.</p>
<p>While he was indulging in these sad reflections, he heard a
bullet whistle near his head. The Secesh soldier on the shore had
loaded up his companions&rsquo; muskets, and was doing his best to
bring down the lucky fugitive. His last shot was not a bad one, and
Tom could not help thinking, if the grayback should hit him, that
he would not waste any fine feelings over him. He did not like the
sound of those whizzing bullets, and as he had never boasted of his
courage, he did not scorn to adopt precautionary measures. The
water was three inches deep in the bottom of the bateau; but Tom
deemed it prudent to lie down there until the current should bear
him out of the reach of the rebel bullets.</p>
<p>He maintained this recumbent posture for half an hour or more,
listening to the balls that frequently whistled over his head. Once
he ventured to raise his head, and discovered, not one man, but a
dozen, on the shore, which accounted for the rapid firing he heard.
When he looked up again, his bateau had passed round a bend, and he
was no longer exposed to the fire of the enemy.</p>
<p>From his heart Tom thanked God for his escape. He was
religiously grateful for the aid which Providence had rendered him,
and when he thought how near he had stood to the brink of
destruction, he realized how narrow the span between the Here and
the Hereafter. And the moral of his reflections was, that if he
stood so near to the open gate of death, he ought always to live
wisely and well, and ever be prepared to pass the portals which
separate time from eternity.</p>
<p>Tom&rsquo;s thoughts were sad and heavy. He could not banish
from his mind the face of the rebel, as he raised his hand to his
breast, where he had received his mortal wound. That countenance,
full of hate and revenge, haunted him for weeks afterwards, in the
solitude of his tent, and on his midnight vigils as a sentinel.</p>
<p>As he sat in the boat, thinking of the events of the morning,
and listening to the mournful rippling of the waters, which, to his
subdued soul, sounded like the requiem of his victim, he was
challenged from the shore again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who comes there!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tom jumped up, and saw a sentinel on the bank pointing his gun
at him. He surveyed the form with anxious interest; but this time
he had nothing to fear, for the soldier wore the blue uniform of
the United States army.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Friend,&rdquo; replied he, as he grasped his paddle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come ashore, or I&rsquo;ll put a bullet through
you,&rdquo; added the sentinel.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t do it!&rdquo; said Tom, with energy.
&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t you see the colors I wear.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come ashore, then.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The soldier boy worked his paddle with vigor and skill, and it
was astonishing to observe with what better success than when
invited to land by the grayback up the river. The guard assisted
him in landing and securing his boat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who are you?&rdquo; demanded he, as he gazed at
Tom&rsquo;s wet and soiled garments.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was taken prisoner at Bull Run, and came back on my own
hook.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps you were, but you can&rsquo;t pass these
lines,&rdquo; said the soldier.</p>
<p>Tom was sent to the Federal camp, and passed from one officer to
another, till he was finally introduced to General Banks, at
Harper&rsquo;s Ferry. He was questioned in regard to his own
adventures, the country he had passed through, and the troops of
the enemy he had seen. When, to use his own expression, he had been
&ldquo;pumped dry,&rdquo; he was permitted to rest a few days, and
then forwarded to his regiment.</p>

<p class="returnTOC"><a href="#Contents">Return to Table of

<p>Though Tom Somers had been absent from the regiment only a
fortnight, it seemed to him as though a year had elapsed since the
day of the battle when he had stood shoulder to shoulder with his
townsmen and friends. He had been ordered to report to the provost
marshal at Washington, where he learned that his regiment was at
Bladensburg, about six miles from the city. Being provided with the
necessary pass and &ldquo;transportation,&rdquo; he soon reached
the camp.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tom Somers! Tom Somers!&rdquo; shouted several of his
comrades, as soon as they recognized him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Three cheers for Tom Somers!&rdquo; shouted Bob
Dornton.</p>
<p>The soldier boy was a favorite in the company, and his return
was sufficient to justify such a proceeding. The cheers, therefore,
were given with tremendous enthusiasm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tom, I&rsquo;m glad to see you!&rdquo; said old Hapgood,
with extended hand, while his eyes filled with tears. &ldquo;I was
afeared we should never see you again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The fugitive shook hands with every member of the company who
was present. His reception was in the highest degree gratifying to
him, and he was determined always to merit the good will of his
companions in arms.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, fellows, tell us what the news is,&rdquo; said Tom,
as he seated himself on a camp stool before the tent of his
mess.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There are letters for you, Tom, in the hands of the
orderly,&rdquo; added one of his friends. &ldquo;I suppose you have
got a bigger story to tell than any of us, but you shall have a
chance to read your letters first.&rdquo;</p>
<p>These precious missives from the loved ones at home were given
to him, and the soldier boy opened them with fear and trembling,
lest he should find in them some bad news; but his mother and all
the family were well. One of them was written since the battle, and
it was evidently penned with deep solicitude for his fate, of which
nothing had been heard.</p>
<p>Hapgood, who sat by him while he read his letters, assured him
that his mother must know, by this time, that he was not killed,
for all the men had written to their friends since the battle. The
captain who had escaped from Sudley church had reported him alive
and well, but he had no information in regard to his escape.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are all well, and every thing goes on about the same
as usual in Pinchbrook,&rdquo; wrote one of his older sisters.
&ldquo;John is so bent upon going to sea in the navy, that it is as
much as mother can do to keep him at home. He says the country
wants him, and he wants to go; and what&rsquo;s more, he must go.
We haven&rsquo;t heard a word from father since he left home; but
Captain Barney read in the paper that his vessel had been sunk in
the harbor of Norfolk to block up the channel. We can only hope
that he is safe, and pray that God will have him in his holy
keeping.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Squire Pemberton was dreadful mad because his son went
into the army. He don&rsquo;t say a word about politics
now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In a letter from John, he learned that Captain Barney had
advanced the money to pay the interest on the note, and that Squire
Pemberton had not said a word about foreclosing the mortgage. His
brother added that he was determined to go into the navy, even if
he had to run away. He could get good wages, and he thought it was
a pity that he should not do his share towards supporting the
family.</p>
<p>Tom finished his letters, and was rejoiced to find that his
friends at home were all well and happy; and in a few days more, a
letter from him would gladden their hearts with the intelligence of
his safe return to the regiment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All well&mdash;ain&rsquo;t they?&rdquo; asked Hapgood, as
Tom folded up the letters and put them in his pocket; and the
veteran could not fail to see, from the happy expression of his
countenance, that their contents were satisfactory.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All well,&rdquo; replied Tom. &ldquo;Where is Fred
Pemberton? I haven&rsquo;t seen him yet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In the hospital: he&rsquo;s sick, or thinks he is,&rdquo;
answered Hapgood. &ldquo;Ben Lethbridge is in the guard house. He
attempted to run away while we were coming over from Shuter&rsquo;s
Hill.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who were killed, and who were wounded? I haven&rsquo;t
heard a word about the affair, you know,&rdquo; asked Tom.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sergeant Bradford was wounded and taken prisoner.
Sergeant Brown was hit by a shell, but not hurt much. The second
lieutenant was wounded in the foot, and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>A loud laugh from the men interrupted the statement.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What are you laughing at?&rdquo; demanded Tom.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He resigned,&rdquo; added Bob Dornton, chuckling.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You said he was wounded?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t say so; the lieutenant said so himself,
and hobbled about with a big cane for a week; but as soon as his
resignation was accepted, he threw away his stick, and walked as
well as ever he could.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The boys all laughed heartily, and seemed to enjoy the joke
prodigiously. Tom thought it was a remarkable cure, though the
remedy was one which no decent man would be willing to adopt.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How&rsquo;s Captain Benson?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s better; he felt awful bad because he
wasn&rsquo;t in that battle. The colonel has gone home, sick. He
has more pluck than body. He was sun-struck, and dropped off his
horse, like a dead man, on the field. It&rsquo;s a great pity he
hasn&rsquo;t twice or three times as much body; if he had,
he&rsquo;d make a first-rate officer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was now Tom&rsquo;s turn to relate his adventures; and he
modestly told his story. His auditors were deeply interested in his
narrative, and when he had finished, it was unanimously voted that
Tom was a &ldquo;trump;&rdquo; which I suppose means nothing more
than that he was a smart fellow&mdash;a position which no one who
has read his adventures will be disposed to controvert.</p>
<p>A long period of comparative inactivity for the regiment
followed the battle of Bull Run. General McClellan had been called
from the scene of his brilliant operations in Western Virginia, to
command the army of the Potomac, and he was engaged in the arduous
task of organizing the vast body of loyal troops that rushed
forward to sustain the government in this dark hour of peril.</p>
<p>While at Bladensburg the &mdash;th regiment with three others
were formed into a brigade, the command of which was given to
Hooker&mdash;a name then unknown beyond the circle of his own
friends.</p>
<p>About the first of November the brigade was sent to Budd&rsquo;s
Ferry, thirty miles below Washington, on the Potomac, to watch the
rebels in that vicinity. The enemy had, by this time, closed the
river against the passage of vessels to the capital, by erecting
batteries at various places, the principal of which were at
Evansport, Shipping Point, and Cockpit Point. Budd&rsquo;s Ferry
was a position in the vicinity of these works, and the brigade was
employed in picketing the river, to prevent the enemy on the other
side from approaching, and also to arrest the operations of the
viler traitors on this side, who were attempting to send supplies
to the rebels.</p>
<p>It was not a very exciting life to which the boys of our
regiment were introduced on their arrival at Budd&rsquo;s Ferry,
though the rebel batteries at Shipping Point made a great deal of
noise and smoke at times. As the season advanced the weather began
to grow colder, and the soldiers were called to a new experience in
military life; but as they were gradually inured to the diminishing
temperature, the hardship was less severe than those who gather
around their northern fireside may be disposed to imagine. Tom
continued to be a philosopher, which was better than an extra
blanket; and he got along very well.</p>
<p>It was a dark, cold, and windy night, in December, when Tom
found himself doing picket duty near the mouth of Chickamoxon
Creek. Nobody supposed that any rebel sympathizer would be mad
enough to attempt the passage of the river on such a night as that,
for the Potomac looked alive with the angry waves that beat upon
its broad bosom. Hapgood and Fred Pemberton were with him, and the
party did the best they could to keep themselves comfortable, and
at the same time discharge the duty assigned to them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here, lads,&rdquo; said old Hapgood, who, closely muffled
in his great-coat, was walking up and down the bank of the creek to
keep the blood warm in his veins.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is it, Hapgood?&rdquo; demanded Fred, who was coiled
up on the lee side of a tree, to protect him from the cold blast
that swept down the creek.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hush!&rdquo; said Hapgood. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t make a
noise; there&rsquo;s a boat coming. Down! down! Don&rsquo;t let
them see you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tom and Fred crawled upon the ground to the verge of the creek,
and placed themselves by the side of the veteran.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see any boat,&rdquo; said Tom.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can see her plain enough, with my old eyes. Look up the
creek.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ay, ay! I see her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So do I,&rdquo; added Fred. &ldquo;What shall we
do?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stop her, of course.&rdquo; replied Tom.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s easy enough said, but not so easily done. We
had better send word up to the battery, and let them open upon
her,&rdquo; suggested Fred.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Open upon the man in the moon!&rdquo; replied Tom,
contemptuously. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you see she is under sail, and
driving down like sixty? We must board her!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tom spoke in an emphatic whisper, and pointed to a small boat,
which lay upon the shore. The craft approaching was a small
schooner apparently about five tons burden. The secessionists of
Baltimore or elsewhere had chosen this dark and tempestuous night
to send over a mail and such supplies as could not be obtained, for
love or money, on the other side of the Potomac. Of course, they
expected to run the risk of a few shots from the Union pickets on
the river; but on such a night, and in such a sea, there was very
little danger of their hitting the mark.</p>
<p>Up the creek the water was comparatively smooth; but the little
schooner was driving furiously down the stream, with the wind on
her quarter, and the chances of making a safe and profitable run to
the rebel line, those on board, no doubt, believed were all in
their favor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We have no time to lose,&rdquo; said Hapgood, with
energy, as he pushed off the boat, which lay upon the beach.
&ldquo;Tumble in lively, and be sure your guns are in good
order.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mine is all right,&rdquo; added Tom, as he examined the
cap on his musket, and then jumped into the boat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So is mine,&rdquo; said Fred; &ldquo;but I don&rsquo;t
much like this business. Do you know how many men there are in the
schooner?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t know, and don&rsquo;t care,&rdquo; replied
Tom.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course they are armed. They have revolvers, I&rsquo;ll
bet my month&rsquo;s pay.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you don&rsquo;t want to go, stay on shore,&rdquo;
answered Hapgood, petulantly. &ldquo;But don&rsquo;t make a noise
about it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course I&rsquo;ll go, but I think we are getting into
a bad scrape.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tom and Hapgood held a hurried consultation, which ended in the
former&rsquo;s taking a position in the bow of the boat, while the
other two took their places at the oars. The muskets were laid
across the thwarts, and the rowers pulled out to the middle of the
creek, just in season to intercept the schooner. Of course they
were seen by the men on board of her, who attempted to avoid
them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hallo!&rdquo; said Tom, in a kind of confidential tone.
&ldquo;On board the schooner there! Are you going over?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. What do you want?&rdquo; answered one of the men on
board the vessel.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We want to get over, and are afraid to go in this boat.
Won&rsquo;t you take us over?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who are you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Friends. We&rsquo;ve got a mail bag.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where did you get it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In Washington.&rdquo;</p>
<p>By this time, the schooner had luffed up into the wind, and Tom
directed his companions to pull again. In a moment the boat was
alongside the schooner, and the soldier boy was about to jump upon
her half-deck, when the rebel crew, very naturally, ordered him to
wait till they had satisfied themselves in regard to his secession
proclivities.</p>
<p>There were five men in the schooner, all of whom were seated
near the stern. Tom did not heed the protest of the traitors, but
sprang on board the schooner, followed by his companions.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, tell us who you are before you come any
farther,&rdquo; said one of the men.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Massachusetts soldiers! Surrender, or you are a dead
man,&rdquo; replied Tom, pointing his gun.</p>
<h3><a id="Ch_25" name="Ch_25">Chapter XXV.</a></h3>
<h2>In the Hospital.</h2>
<p class="returnTOC"><a href="#Contents">Return to Table of
Contents</a></p>
<p>The night was very dark, so that the rebels in the boat could
not distinguish the uniform of those who had applied for a passage
on the schooner. Perhaps Tom Somers&rsquo;s experience in the Blue
Ridge and on the Shenandoah had improved his strategic ability, so
that his words and his manner seemed plausible. But as strategy and
cunning always owe their success to the comparative stupidity of
the victims, Tom and his companions gained the half-deck of the
schooner more by the palpable blundering of her crew than through
the brilliancy of their own scheme.</p>
<p>Tom did not stop, in the midst of the exciting enterprise, to
determine the particular reason of his success, as we, his humble
biographer, have done. He was on the enemy&rsquo;s ground, and
confronting the enemy&rsquo;s forces, and logic was as much out of
place as rebellion in a free republican country. He was closely
followed by Hapgood, and at a later period by Fred Pemberton. The
nerves of the latter were not remarkably steady, and as he stepped
on board the schooner, he neglected to take the painter with him;
and the consequence was, that the boat went adrift. It is good
generalship to keep the line of retreat open; and Fred&rsquo;s
neglect had deprived them of all means of retiring from the scene
of action. The only alternative was to fight their way through, and
find safety in success.</p>
<p>To Tom&rsquo;s reply, that the party were Massachusetts
soldiers, the rebel who had acted as spokesman for the crew,
uttered a volley of oaths, expressive of his indignation and
disgust at the sudden check which had been given to their
prosperous voyage.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Surrender!&rdquo; repeated Tom, in energetic tones.</p>
<p>Two of the rebels at the stern discharged their pistols in
answer to the summons&mdash;a piece of impudence which our
Massachusetts soldiers could not tolerate; and they returned the
fire. The secessionists evidently carried revolvers; and a turn of
the barrel enabled them to fire a second volley, which the soldiers
were unable to do, for they had no time to load their guns.</p>
<p>&ldquo;O!&rdquo; groaned Fred, as he sunk down upon the
half-deck. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m hit.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We can&rsquo;t stand this, Hapgood,&rdquo; said Tom,
fiercely, as he leaped into the midst of the party in the standing
room. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s give them the bayonet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Give it to &rsquo;em, Tom!&rdquo; replied the veteran, as
he placed himself by the side of his young companion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will you surrender?&rdquo; demanded Tom, as he thrust
vigorously with his bayonet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We surrender,&rdquo; replied one of the men; but it was
not the one who had spoken before, for he had dropped off his seat
upon the bottom of the boat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Give up your pistols, then,&rdquo; added Hapgood.
&ldquo;You look out for the boat, Tom, and I will take care of
these fellows.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tom sprang to the position which had been occupied by the
spokesman of the party, and grasping the foresheet and the tiller
of the boat, he soon brought her up to the wind. Seating himself in
the stern, he assumed the management of the schooner, while Hapgood
busied himself in taking the pistols from the hands of the rebels,
and exploring their pockets, in search of other dangerous
weapons.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How are you, Fred?&rdquo; shouted Tom, when the pressing
business of the moment had been disposed of. &ldquo;Are you much
hurt?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid my time&rsquo;s most up,&rdquo; replied
he, faintly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where are you hit?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In the face; the ball went through my head, I
suppose,&rdquo; he added, in tones that were hardly audible, in the
warring of the December blast.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Keep up a good heart, Fred, and we will soon be ashore.
Have you got an easy place?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, the water dashes over me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t you move him aft, Hapgood?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pretty soon; when I get these fellows fixed,&rdquo;
replied the veteran, who had cut the rope nearest to his hands, and
was securing the arms of the prisoners behind them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is no fear of them now. We have got two revolvers
apiece, and we can have it all our own way, if they show
fight.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But Hapgood had bound the rebels by this time, and with tender
care he lifted his wounded companion down into the standing room,
and made him as comfortable as the circumstances would permit.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, where are we, Hapgood?&rdquo; asked Tom, who had
been vainly peering ahead to discover some familiar object by which
to steer. I can&rsquo;t see the first thing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know where we are,&rdquo; replied Hapgood.
&ldquo;I never was much of a sailor, and I leave the navigating all
to you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can navigate well enough, if I knew where we
were,&rdquo; added Tom, who had thus far been utterly unable to
ascertain the &ldquo;ship&rsquo;s position.&rdquo;</p>
<p>During the brief struggle for the possession of the schooner,
she had drifted some distance, which had caused the new commander
to lose his bearings. The shore they had just left had disappeared,
as though it had been swallowed up by an earthquake. No lights were
allowed on shore, where they could be seen from the river, for they
afforded so many targets to the artillerymen in the rebel
batteries. The more Tom tried to discover a familiar object to
steer by, the more it seemed as though the land and everything else
had been cut adrift, and emigrated to foreign parts. Those who have
been in a boat in a very dark night, or in a dense fog, will be
able to appreciate the bewilderment of the skipper of the captured
schooner.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look out, Tom, that you don&rsquo;t run us into some of
those rebel batteries,&rdquo; said Hapgood, after he had watched
the rapid progress of the boat for a few moments. &ldquo;A shot
from a thirty-two pounder would be a pill we couldn&rsquo;t
swallow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No danger of that, Hapgood,&rdquo; answered Tom,
confidently.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know about that, my boy,&rdquo; answered
the veteran, in a tone heavy with dire anxiety.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know it. The schooner was running with the wind on her
starboard quarter when we boarded her. We are now close-hauled, and
of course we can&rsquo;t make the shore on the other side while we
are on this tack.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Well, I don&rsquo;t know much about it, Tom, but if you say its
all right, I&rsquo;m satisfied; that&rsquo; all. I&rsquo;d trust
you just as far as I would General McClennon, and you know we all
b&rsquo;lieve in him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What are you going to do with us?&rdquo; asked one of the
rebels, who began to exhibit some interest in the fate of the
schooner.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose you will find good quarters in Fort
McHenry,&rdquo; replied Tom. &ldquo;Where do you belong?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In Baltimore.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What are you doing here, then?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We go in for the South.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go in, then!&rdquo; added Tom, laughing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll fetch up where all the rest of &rsquo;em
do,&rdquo; said Hapgood.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How&rsquo;s that fellow that was hit?&rdquo; asked Tom,
pointing to the rebel who lay in the middle of the standing
room.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I guess it&rsquo;s all right with him,&rdquo; replied
Hapgood, bending over the silent form. &ldquo;No; he isn&rsquo;t
dead.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have it!&rdquo; shouted Tom, suddenly crowding the helm
hard-a-lee.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What, Tom?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I see where we are. We are running up the river. I see
the land on the weather bow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The schooner was put about, and after running with the wind
amidships for ten or fifteen minutes, Tom discovered the outline of
Mrs. Budd&rsquo;s house, which was directly under the guns of the
Union battery.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stand by the fore halliards, Hapgood,&rdquo; said Tom, as
the boat came about again. &ldquo;Let go!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The foresail came down, and Tom sprang upon the pier, as the
schooner came up under its lee. In a moment the boat was made fast.
By this time the pickets appeared.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who comes there?&rdquo; demanded the soldier.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Friends!&rdquo; replied Tom.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Advance, friend, and give the countersign.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Little Mac,&rdquo; whispered the soldier boy in the ear
of the sentinel.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who are you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Co. K.&rdquo; answered Tom.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the row? The long roll was beat just now,
and the whole regiment is in line. What was that firing?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We have captured this boat, and five prisoners, one of
them wounded, if not dead.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bully for you,&rdquo; replied the picket.</p>
<p>They were soon joined by a squad of men, and Fred Pemberton and
the wounded rebel were conveyed to the hospital, while the four
prisoners were conducted to a secure place. Hapgood and Tom then
hastened to the parade, where the regiment was drawn up, and
reported the events which had just transpired. It was unanimously
voted by officers and privates that the picket guard had done
&ldquo;a big thing,&rdquo; and they were warmly and generously
commended for their skill and bravery.</p>
<p>Hapgood and Tom requested permission to go to the hospital and
see their companion. They found that the surgeon had already
dressed his wound.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will he die?&rdquo; asked Tom, full of solicitude for his
friend.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Die! no; it&rsquo;s a mere scratch. The ball ploughed
into his cheek a little way,&rdquo; replied the surgeon. &ldquo;It
isn&rsquo;t a bad wound. He was more scared than hurt.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am glad it is no worse,&rdquo; said Captain Benson,
who, with fatherly solicitude for his men, had come to the hospital
as soon as the company was dismissed. &ldquo;But what ails you,
Tom? You look pale.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing, captain.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you sure?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think I am badly hurt. I believe one of
those pistol balls grazed my side; but I hardly felt it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let me see,&rdquo; said the surgeon.</p>
<p>The doctor opened Tom&rsquo;s coat, and his gray shirt was found
to be saturated with blood.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a worse wound than Pemberton&rsquo;s.
Didn&rsquo;t you know it, Tom?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, of course I knew it; but I didn&rsquo;t think it
was any thing,&rdquo; replied Tom, apologetically. &ldquo;I knew it
wouldn&rsquo;t do to drop down, or we should all be in Dixie in
half an hour.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are my man for the present,&rdquo; said the doctor,
as he proceeded to a further examination of the wound.</p>
<p>Tom was hit in the side by one of the pistol bullets. As I have
not the surgeon&rsquo;s report of the case, I cannot give a minute
description of it; but he comforted Hapgood and the captain with
the assurance that, though severe, it was not a dangerous
wound.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tom Somers, there&rsquo;s a sergeant&rsquo;s warrant in
Company K for one of you three men,&rdquo; said Captain Benson,
when the patient was comfortably settled upon his camp bed.
&ldquo;The colonel told me to give him the name of the most
deserving man in my company.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Give it to Tom,&rdquo; said Hapgood, promptly. &ldquo;He
led off in this matter, and ef&rsquo;t hadn&rsquo;t been for him,
we should all have been on t&rsquo;other side of the river, and
p&rsquo;raps on t&rsquo;other side of Jordan, afore this time. And
then, to think that the poor fellow stood by, and handled the boat
like a commodore, when the life-blood was runnin&rsquo; out of him
all the time! It belongs to Tom.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Give it to Tom,&rdquo; added Fred, who lay near the
patient.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, Captain Benson,&rdquo; interposed Tom, faintly.
&ldquo;Hapgood is an old soldier, and deserves it more than I do.
Give it to him, and I shall be better satisfied than if you give it
to me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tom Somers!&rdquo; exclaimed old Hapgood, a flood of
tears sliding down his furrowed cheeks, &ldquo;I won&rsquo;t stand
nothin&rsquo; of the sort! I&rsquo;d jump into the river and drownd
myself before I&rsquo;d take it, after what you&rsquo;ve
done.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are both worthy of it,&rdquo; added Captain
Benson.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Please give it to Hapgood,&rdquo; pleaded Tom. &ldquo;He
first proposed going out after the little schooner.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Give it to Tom, cap&rsquo;n. It&rsquo;ll help heal his
wound,&rdquo; said Hapgood.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No; it would do me more good to have you receive
it,&rdquo; protested Tom.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, here, I can&rsquo;t have this battle fought in the
hospital,&rdquo; interposed the surgeon. &ldquo;They are good
friends, captain, and whichever one you give it to, the other will
be suited. You had better settle the case at
head-quarters.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you please, Captain Benson, I would like to have
Hapgood stay with me to-night, if he can be spared.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The veteran was promptly detailed for hospital duty, and the
captain returned to his quarters to decide the momentous question
in regard to the sergeant&rsquo;s warrant.</p>
<h3><a id="Ch_26" name="Ch_26">Chapter XXVI.</a></h3>
<h2>Tom is Sentimental.</h2>
<p class="returnTOC"><a href="#Contents">Return to Table of
Contents</a></p>
<p>The little schooner which the picket guard had captured was
loaded with valuable supplies for the rebels, which of course were
confiscated without ceremony. The mail bag which was on board
contained a great many letters from traitors in Baltimore, some of
whom were exposed by the capture of their treasonable
correspondence.</p>
<p>Tom&rsquo;s wound proved to be more serious than even the
surgeon had anticipated; but the best care which it was possible to
give in a military hospital was bestowed upon him. Old Hapgood, in
recognition of his services on that eventful night, was permitted
to be near the patient as much as the interests of the service
would permit; and the old man was happy when seated by the rude
couch of the soldier boy, ministering to his necessities, or
cheering him with bright hopes of the future. A strong friendship
had grown up between them, for Tom&rsquo;s kind heart and brave
conduct produced a deep impression upon the old man.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here, Tom,&rdquo; said Captain Benson, as he approached
the sufferer, a few days after he entered the hospital, and laid a
paper upon the bed. &ldquo;Here&rsquo;s a prescription which the
colonel says you must take.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is it?&rdquo; asked Tom, with a faint smile.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A sergeant&rsquo;s warrant.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Glory, glory, hallelujah, as we go marching on!&rdquo;
exclaimed old Hapgood, jumping up like a youth of sixteen, and
swinging his cap above his head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shut up, there!&rdquo; shouted the hospital steward.
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you know any better than to make such a racket
in this place?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I beg pardon, Jameson. I forgot where I was,&rdquo;
apologized the veteran. &ldquo;The news was so good I
couldn&rsquo;t help it. Our Tom is a sergeant now!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not yet, Hapgood,&rdquo; replied Tom, feebly. &ldquo;I
can&rsquo;t accept it, Captain Benson; it belongs to Hapgood, sir,
and I shall feel a great deal better if you put his name in place
of mine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t do it, cap&rsquo;n!&rdquo; interposed the old
man, vehemently. &ldquo;Tom shall be a brigadier general if the war
lasts one year more. I should feel like a whipped kitten if that
warrant was altered.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The matter has been fully and fairly considered at
head-quarters, and there is no such thing as altering the decision
now; so, Tom, you can put the stripes on your arm just as soon as
you please.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hapgood insisted, the surgeon insisted, and the captain
insisted; and Tom was too sick to hold way with them in an
argument, and his name was placed upon the roster of the company as
a sergeant. He was proud of the distinction which had been
conferred upon him, though he thought Hapgood, as an older and
abler soldier, was better entitled to the honor than himself.</p>
<p>It was six weeks before Tom was able to enter upon the actual
enjoyment of the well-merited promotion which he had won by his
gallantry; but when he appeared before the company with the chevron
of the sergeant upon his arm, he was lustily cheered by his
comrades, and it was evident that the appointment was a very
popular one. Not even the grumblers, of whom there is a full quota
in every regiment, deemed it prudent to growl at the decision of
the officers. If any one ventured to suggest that he was too young
to be placed over older and stronger men, his friends replied, that
men in the army were measured by bravery and skill, not by
years.</p>
<p>If my young readers wish to know why Tom&rsquo;s appointment was
so well received by his companions in arms, I can only reply, that
he had not only been brave and cheerful in the midst of peril and
hardship, but he was kind and obliging to his comrades. He had
always been willing to help those that needed help, to sympathize
with those in trouble, and generally to do all he could to render
those around him happy.</p>
<p>Above all these considerations, Tom was a young man of high
principle. He had obeyed his mother&rsquo;s parting injunction,
often repeated in the letters which came to him from home, and had
faithfully &ldquo;read his Testament.&rdquo; Without being a
hypocrite or a canting saint, Tom carried about with him the true
elements of Christian character.</p>
<p>Tom had fought a greater battle than that in which he had been
engaged at Bull Run a hundred times, in resisting the temptations
which beset him from within and without. True to God and true to
himself, he had won the victory. Though his lot was cast in the
midst of men who swore, gambled, and drank liquor, he had shunned
these vices, and loved the sinner while he hated the sin. Such a
person could not fail to win the respect of his companions. Though
he had been jeered at and insulted for being sober, honest, and
pious, he had fought down and lived down all these vilifiers, and
won their esteem.</p>
<p>It must be acknowledged that Tom&rsquo;s piety was of the robust
type. He would not allow any man to insult him; and after the
chastisement he had given Ben Lethbridge, not even those who were
strong enough to whip him were disposed to trespass upon his rights
and dignity. Perhaps Tom&rsquo;s creed needed a little revising;
but he lived under martial law, which does not take cognizance of
insults and revilings. He was willing to be smitten on the one
cheek, and on the other also, for the good of his country, or even
his friends, but not to be wantonly insulted.</p>
<p>The influence of Tom&rsquo;s principles was not confined to
himself, for &ldquo;a little leaven leaveneth the whole
lump.&rdquo; This was particularly true of Hapgood, who, more
through Tom&rsquo;s preaching and practice than from any strength
in his own character, had steadily maintained his purpose to
abstain from intoxicating drinks, though occasional opportunities
were presented for the indulgence of his darling vice. Tom and he
read the Testament and other good books which were sent to the
regiment, and both profited by them.</p>
<p>When the soldier boy was discharged from the hospital, the
surgeon gave him a pair of woolen socks, from a case of them which
had been sent by the friends of the soldier in Boston and its
vicinity. He was very much in need of them, and from the depths of
his heart he blessed the ladies who had done this good work. He
unrolled the socks, and proceeded to pull one of them on. It was as
good a fit as though his mother had knit it on purpose for him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;God bless the lady that knit these socks!&rdquo;
exclaimed Tom, as he began to draw on the other.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Amen!&rdquo; replied Hapgood, who was watching the
operation in full sympathy with his protege.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Eh! what&rsquo;s this?&rdquo; added Tom, for his foot had
met with an obstruction in its passage down the leg.</p>
<p>He pulled off the sock, and thrusting his hand into it, took
therefrom a letter enclosed in an envelope.</p>
<p>&ldquo;See that, uncle?&rdquo; said he, exhibiting the
prize.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is it, Tom? Open it quick,&rdquo; replied
Hapgood.</p>
<p>The soldier boy broke the envelope, and took from it a note
enclosing a photograph. Tom looked at the picture with a feeling of
pleasure, which would have caused the original of the miniature,
the author of the note, and the author of the socks, to blush up to
her eyes if she had beheld the expression of admiration which
glowed upon the handsome, manly face of the young sergeant.</p>
<p>&ldquo;By all that&rsquo;s lovely, isn&rsquo;t she a
beauty!&rdquo; exclaimed Tom, rapturously, as he glanced from the
picture to Hapgood, who was looking over his shoulder.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s hahnsome, and no mistake,&rdquo; replied the
veteran, with a grim smile.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, she is!&rdquo; added Tom, whose eyes were riveted
to the photograph.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, why don&rsquo;t you read the letter, Tom?&rdquo;
demanded the old soldier, after the young man had gazed with
blushing cheek upon the sweet face of the author of his socks for
full five minutes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I guess I will,&rdquo; said Tom; but he did not; for the
picture seemed to be glory and beauty enough to satisfy him for the
present.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Read the letter, Tom!&rdquo; shouted the veteran, after
he had waited as long as the nature of the case seemed to
require.</p>
<p>The soldier boy carefully placed the photograph in the envelope,
and unfolded the letter. It was written in a beautiful hand, which
looked as soft and delicate as the fair fingers which had penned
the lines. He glanced at it as a whole, admired the penmanship, and
the fairy-like symmetry that make up the <em>tout-ensemble</em> of
the page, and was about to dissolve into another rhapsody, when
Hapgood, who was not half so sentimental as the sergeant, became
impatient to know the contents of the missive. Tom read it aloud to
the stoical veteran; and though we cannot clothe its sweet words in
the fairy chirography which transported our hero, and made the
letter a dream of bliss to him, we shall venture to present it to
our curious readers, stiffened and hardened into the dull, cold
forms of the printer&rsquo;s art.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>No.&mdash;&mdash;, RUTLAND STREET, BOSTON, <em>Nov.</em> 5,
1861.</p>
<p>MY DEAR SOLDIER:&mdash;</p>
<p>This is the first pair of socks I ever knit; and I send them to
you with my blessing upon the brave defenders of my country. I hope
they will keep your feet warm, and thus keep your heart warm
towards God and our blessed land.</p>
<p>Grandma says I am a silly girl, and I suppose I am; but if you
feel half as much interest in me as I do in the person who will
wear the first pair of socks I ever knit, you will wish to know how
I look; therefore I send you my photograph.</p>
<p>I very much desire to know whether my work has done any good;
whether my socks are ever worn in a battle; and most of all, I
desire to know how the noble fellow looks that wears them.
Therefore I beg you to answer my letter, and also to send me your
photograph, if you can conveniently.</p>
<p>Now, my dear soldier, be brave and true, and, above all, do not
run away from the rebels with my socks on your feet. You may
retreat when your officers order you to retire; but if you are a
coward, and find yourself compelled to run away, please pull them
off before you do so, for I should die with mortification if I
thought I had knit a pair of socks for a Union soldier to run away
in.</p>
<p class="rgt">Truly yours, for our flag and our country.<br />
LILIAN ASHFORD.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Well, if that gal ain&rsquo;t a trump, then there
ain&rsquo;t no snakes in Virginny!&rdquo; exclaimed Hapgood.
&ldquo;She&rsquo;s got the true grit, and no mistake.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s so,&rdquo; replied the recipient of the
gift, thoughtfully, as he bent down, and began to pull off the sock
which encased his left foot.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What are you doing?&rdquo; demanded Hapgood, surprised at
this new movement of his companion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t wear these socks yet, uncle,&rdquo; replied
he.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why not?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t she say she wants them worn in a battle?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tom, you are a little fool!&rdquo; added the veteran,
petulantly. &ldquo;Are you going with cold feet just to please a
silly gal, whose head is as full of moonshine as an egg is of meat.
Put on the socks, and keep your feet warm. If you don&rsquo;t,
I&rsquo;ll write to her, and tell what a fool you are.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tom did put them on, but he could not help feeling that uncle
Hapgood, as he was familiarly called in the camp, did not
understand and appreciate his sentiments. The socks seemed to be
too precious to be worn in the vulgar mud of Maryland. To him there
was something ethereal about them, and it looked a little like
profanation to put any thing emanating from the fairy fingers of
the original of that photograph, and the author of that letter,
upon his feet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now you act like a sensible fellow, as you are,
Tom,&rdquo; said Hapgood, as the sergeant put on his army
brogans.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, uncle, one thing is certain: I never will run away
from the rebels with these socks on,&rdquo; added Tom, with a rich
glow of enthusiasm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If Gen&rsquo;l McClennon don&rsquo;t stir his stumps
pretty soon, you&rsquo;ll wear &rsquo;em out afore you git a chance
to run away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tom, almost for the first time since he had been in the army,
wanted to be alone. With those socks on, it seemed just as though
he was walking the streets of the New Jerusalem, with heaven and
stacks of silver-fringed and golden-tinged clouds beneath his feet,
buried up to the eyes in floods of liquid moonshine.</p>
<p>If &ldquo;grandma&rdquo; really thought that Lilian Ashford was
a silly girl, and if Lilian really supposed so herself, it must be
added, in justification of her conduct, that she had given the
soldier boy a new incentive to do his duty nobly, and kindled in
his soul a holy aspiration to serve God and his country with
renewed zeal and fidelity.</p>
<h3><a id="Ch_27" name="Ch_27">Chapter XXVII.</a></h3>
<h2>The Confederate Deserter.</h2>
<p class="returnTOC"><a href="#Contents">Return to Table of
Contents</a></p>
<p>While Tom was in the hospital, he received a letter from his
sister, informing him that his brother John had actually entered
the navy, and with his mother&rsquo;s consent. The news from home
was so favorable, that the soldier boy was pleased to hear that
Jack had realized his darling wish, and that he was now in his
element.</p>
<p>Intelligence from home, accompanied with letters, papers, books,
comforts, and luxuries of various kinds, reached him every two or
three weeks; and when the news went back that Tom had been made a
sergeant for gallant conduct, there was a great sensation in
Pinchbrook. The letters which reached him after the receipt of this
gratifying announcement contained all the gossip of the place in
regard to the important event. Of course, Tom was delighted by
these letters, and was more than ever determined to be diligent and
faithful in the discharge of his duties, and never to disgrace the
name he bore. He was confident his friends would never have
occasion to blush for his conduct&mdash;including the original of
the photograph, the author of the letter and of the socks.</p>
<p>Tom recovered from the effects of his wound, as we have before
intimated, and took his place in the regimental line as a sergeant.
January and February passed away without any very stirring events;
but in the month of March came indications of activity. The rebels
began to draw in their lines, by abandoning various points, till
the nation was startled by the evacuation of their strongly
fortified position at Manassas, and the forts in front of
Budd&rsquo;s Ferry were suddenly left for the occupation of the
Federal troops.</p>
<p>Hooker&rsquo;s men crossed the Potomac, and Tom was once more on
the sacred soil of Virginia. Skirmishers were sent out in various
directions, and though a deserted camp, which had been hastily
abandoned, was found, there were no rebels to be seen. The Union
boys were not disposed to leave their investigations at this
interesting point, and they pursued their way still farther into
the country. Somehow or other, Tom and his party did not receive
the order to return, and the enterprising young hero continued his
march in search of further adventures. It was altogether too tame
for him and the congenial spirits in his section to retire without
seeing a live rebel or two; and I am not sure, if their desire had
not been gratified, that they would not have penetrated to
Fredericksburg, and captured that citadel of rebellion in advance
to General Augur, who visited the place in April.</p>
<p>As it was, they stumbled upon the pickets of a rebel force, and
as soon as their uniform was identified they had the honor of being
fired upon, though none of them had the honor of being killed in
the midst of their virtual disobedience of orders. But their
appearance created a panic among the Confederates, who had no means
of knowing that they were not the pioneers of a whole division of
Union troops, for General McClellan had removed the spell which
bound the loyal army to its camps, and corps, divisions, and
brigades were pushing forward into the dominion of the
traitors.</p>
<p>The alarm was given, and Tom saw that he was rushing into a bad
scrape; and as prudence is as much a requisite of the good soldier
as bravery, he ordered his men to fall back. Rebels are very much
like ill-natured curs, ever ready to pursue a retreating foe, or
run away from an advancing one. The Confederates chased them, and
as the legs of the former seemed to be in remarkably good
condition, the sergeant came to the conclusion that it would not be
safe to run too fast.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Halt!&rdquo; shouted he; and the men promptly obeyed the
order.</p>
<p>They discharged their muskets, and then made a demonstration
towards the enemy, who, obeying their instinct, ran away as fast as
their legs would carry them. Taking advantage of this movement on
their part, Tom again ordered a retreat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They are after us again,&rdquo; said Hapgood. &ldquo;I
hope there ain&rsquo;t no cavalry within hearing. If there is, we
may take a journey to Richmond.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They have stopped to load their guns,&rdquo; replied Tom.
&ldquo;We will use our legs now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;See that, Tom!&rdquo; said Hapgood, suddenly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s one of them rushing towards us all
alone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He has thrown up his gun. The others are yelling to him
to come back. What does that mean?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He is a deserter; he wants to get away from them. There
he comes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, and there comes the rest of them&mdash;the whole
rebel army&mdash;more than a million of them,&rdquo; said Fred
Pemberton. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s time for us to be going.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;See! They are firing at him. Forward!&rdquo; added Tom,
leading the way.</p>
<p>The party rushed forward, for a short distance; but the dozen
rebels had been re&euml;nforced, and it was madness to rush into
the very teeth of danger. Tom ordered his men to halt and fire at
will. The deserter, probably finding that he was between two fires,
turned aside from the direct course he was pursuing, and sought
shelter in the woods. The sergeant then directed his men to retire,
for whether the retreat of the runaway rebel was covered or not, it
was no longer safe to remain.</p>
<p>Fortunately the Confederates were more in doubt than the
Unionists; and perhaps expecting to fall upon a larger body of the
latter, they abandoned the pursuit, and returned to their posts.
Nothing was seen of the deserter for some time, and Tom concluded
that he had lost his way in the woods, or had missed the direction
taken by the Federal scouts.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He was a plucky fellow, any how,&rdquo; said one of the
men, &ldquo;to attempt to run away in the very face of his
companions.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, he timed it well, for he started just when their
guns were all empty,&rdquo; added another.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not sorry he missed us,&rdquo; continued
Hapgood. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t like a desarter, no how. It goes
right agin my grain.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But he was running from the wrong to the right
side,&rdquo; replied Tom.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t keer if he was. Them colors on
t&rsquo;other side were his&rsquo;n. He chose &rsquo;em for
himself, and it&rsquo;s mean to run away from &rsquo;em. If a
man&rsquo;s go&rsquo;n to be a rebel, let him be one, and stick to
it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t know any thing about it, uncle. Thousands
of men have been forced into the rebel army, and I don&rsquo;t
blame them for getting out of it the best way they can. I should do
so.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That may be. Tom; that may be,&rdquo; added the veteran,
taking off his cap and rubbing his bald head, as though a new idea
had penetrated it. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t think of that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s a brave man, whoever he is, and whatever he
is.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He must want to get away from &rsquo;em pretty bad, or he
wouldn&rsquo;t have run that risk. I shouldn&rsquo;t wonder if they
hit him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps he is wounded, and gone into the woods there to
die,&rdquo; suggested Tom.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Halloo!&rdquo; shouted some one in the rear of them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s your man,&rdquo; said Hapgood.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Halloo!&rdquo; cried the same voice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Halloo, yourself!&rdquo; shouted Hapgood in reply to the
hail.</p>
<p>The party halted, and after waiting a few moments, the rebel
deserter came in sight. He was apparently a man of fifty; and no
mendicant of St. Giles, who followed begging as a profession, could
have given himself a more wretched and squalid appearance, if he
had devoted a lifetime to the study of making himself look
miserable. He wore a long black and gray beard, uncut and unkempt,
and snarled, tangled, and knotted into the most fantastic forms.
His gray uniform, plentifully bedaubed with Virginia mud, was torn
in a hundred places, and hung in tatters upon his emaciated frame.
On his head was an old felt hat, in a terribly dilapidated
condition. He wore one boot and one shoe, which he had probably
taken from the common sewer of Richmond, or some other southern
city; they were ripped to such an extent that the
&ldquo;uppers&rdquo; went flipperty-flap as he walked, and had the
general appearance of the open mouth of the mythic dragon, with
five bare toes in each to represent teeth.</p>
<p>As he approached, the unthinking soldiers of the party indulged
in screams of laughter at the uncouth appearance of the whilom
rebel; and certainly the character in tableau or farce need not
have spoken, to convulse any audience that ever assembled in
Christendom. Rip Van Winkle, with the devastations and
dilapidations of five-and-twenty years hanging about him, did not
present a more forlorn appearance than did this representative of
the Confederate army.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What are you laughing at?&rdquo; demanded the deserter,
not at all delighted with this reception.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I say, old fellow, how long since you escaped from the
rag-bag?&rdquo; jeered one of the men.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the price of boots in Richmond now?&rdquo;
asked another.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who&rsquo;s your barber?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Silence, men!&rdquo; interposed Tom, sternly, for he
could not permit his boys to make fun of the wretchedness of any
human being.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll sell you out for paper stock,&rdquo; said Ben
Lethbridge, who had just returned from three months&rsquo; service
in the Rip-Raps for desertion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shut up, Ben!&rdquo; added Tom.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dry up, all of you!&rdquo; said Corporal Snyder.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who and what are you?&rdquo; asked Tom, of the
deserter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m a Union man!&rdquo; replied the stranger with
emphasis; &ldquo;and I didn&rsquo;t expect to be treated in this
way after all I&rsquo;ve suffered.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They thought you were a rebel. You wear the colors of the
rebel army,&rdquo; answered the sergeant, willing to explain the
rudeness of his men.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I suppose I do look rather the worse for the
wear,&rdquo; added the grayback, glancing down at the tattered
uniform he wore. &ldquo;I joined the rebel army, after I had tried
every way in the world to get out of this infernal country; but I
never fired a gun at a Union man. Seems to me, sergeant, I&rsquo;ve
seen you before somewhere. What&rsquo;s your name? Where did you
come from?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pinchbrook, Massachusetts; and most of us hail from the
same place.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Creation!&rdquo; exclaimed the deserter. &ldquo;You
don&rsquo;t say so!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your voice sounds familiar to me,&rdquo; added Tom; and
for some reason his chest was heaving violently beneath his
suddenly accelerated respiration.</p>
<p>As he spoke, he walked towards the dilapidated rebel, who had
not ventured to come within twenty feet of the party.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you say Pinchbrook?&rdquo; demanded the stranger, who
began to display a great deal of emotion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pinchbrook, sir,&rdquo; added Tom; and so intensely was
he excited, that the words were gasped from his lips.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s your name?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thomas Somers,&rdquo; replied the sergeant.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tom!&rdquo; screamed the deserter, rushing forward.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Father!&rdquo; cried Tom, as he grasped the hand of the
phantom Confederate.</p>
<p>The soldiers of the party were transfixed with astonishment at
this unexpected scene, and they stood like statues gazing at the
meeting of father and son, till the final development of their
relationship, when the muscles of their faces relaxed, and the
expression of wonder gave place to joyous sympathy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Captain Somers, of Pinchbrook!&rdquo; shouted old
Hapgood; and the men joined with him in a roar of intense
satisfaction, that made the woods ring.</p>
<h3><a id="Ch_28" name="Ch_28">Chapter XXVIII.</a></h3>
<h2>On the Peninsula.</h2>
<p class="returnTOC"><a href="#Contents">Return to Table of
Contents</a></p>
<p>The scene between Captain Somers and his son was very affecting
and very exciting; and if the soldiers had all been uncles and
first cousins of the parties, they could not have manifested more
interest on the joyous occasion. The father wept, and the son wept;
for each, amid the terrible experience of these troublous times,
had hardly expected to meet the other.</p>
<p>For several minutes they held each other by the hand, laughing
and weeping alternately, and neither being able to express the
intense emotions which agitated him. The men shouted and laughed in
full sympathy with the reunited sire and son.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad to see you, Tom,&rdquo; said Captain
Somers, as he wiped away the tears that were sliding down upon his
grizzly beard. &ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t cried before for thirty
years; I&rsquo;m ashamed of it, Tom, but I can&rsquo;t help
it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t expect to find you here, father, and
clothed in the rebel uniform; but I&rsquo;m glad to see you in any
uniform,&rdquo; replied the soldier boy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So you&rsquo;re in the army, Tom,&rdquo; continued the
father, gazing with satisfaction at the neat appearance of the
sergeant.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir; I enlisted within a fortnight after we heard
that the traitors had bombarded Fort Sumter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I see you&rsquo;ve got three stripes on your
arm.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, Cap&rsquo;n Somers,&rdquo; said Hapgood; &ldquo;Tom
was made a sergeant for gallant conduct on the river in December;
and he deserved his promotion too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad to see you with that uniform on your back,
Tom; and glad to hear that you have behaved well.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was in the battle of Bull Run, father, and was taken
prisoner, but I got away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, Tom, we&rsquo;ll hear about that bimeby,&rdquo;
said the old man, stopping and looking nervously into the face of
his son. &ldquo;I want to ask a great many questions, Tom, but I
hardly dare to do it. You know I haven&rsquo;t heard a word from
home since I left, and it&rsquo;s almost a year now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You needn&rsquo;t be afraid, father; the folks are all
well. I have got a heap of letters at the camp, and you shall read
them all as soon as we get there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is your mother well, Tom?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;First rate.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And John?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir; but he&rsquo;s gone into the navy. He was bound
to be in the fight any how.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;John&rsquo;s a chip of the old block. He wanted to snuff
the salt water afore he was a week old. John&rsquo;s a good sailor,
and he ought to have a good lay wherever he goes,&rdquo; added the
father.</p>
<p>Captain Somers and Tom sat upon the ground for half an hour,
until the fugitive from the rebel army was in some degree rested
after the hard run he had had through the woods. The soldiers
gathered around them, as much interested as though they had been
members of the Somers family. Tom&rsquo;s father had a multitude of
questions to ask about Pinchbrook and its people, all of which were
answered to his satisfaction.</p>
<p>The sergeant thought it was time for the party to move on, and
his father declared that he was able to walk any distance which
would bring him nearer to the home of his wife and children. The
order was given, and the little band resumed its march.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How have you been all this time, father?&rdquo; asked
Tom, as he walked along by the side of Captain Somers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been pretty fairly most of the time. I&rsquo;m
tough and hardy, or I should have been dead afore this time.
We&rsquo;ve been half starved and half frozen in the camp; but I
managed to live through it, hoping and expecting to get away from
those rascally rebels.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where have you been all the time?&rdquo; asked Tom.
&ldquo;Have you been in the rebel army long?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;About four months; but I may as well begin at the
beginning, and tell you the whole story,&rdquo; added the captain.
&ldquo;I got to Norfolk all right, and was there when the news came
up that the rebels had taken Sumter. Every body was mad, and I was
as mad as the rest of them, though not exactly in the same way. I
let on a little with my tongue, and came pretty near being tarred
and feathered, and I think I should have been, if your uncle Wyman
hadn&rsquo;t interfered.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did he settle with you, father?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;After a while he did. He had some fifteen thousand
dollars in New York, which had just been sent over from England,
and as he was secesh, he was terribly afeard the Lincoln government
would confiscate it; so he settled with me, and gave me a power of
attorney to draw his money, pay myself, and take care of what was
over. I&rsquo;ve got the papers safe in my waistbands
now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good! Glory, hallelujah!&rdquo; shouted Tom. &ldquo;We
can pay off old Pemberton now, for it goes against my grain to owe
a dollar to a traitor. But if uncle Wyman is a rebel, and I suppose
he is, I hope the government will confiscate what&rsquo;s over
after you have paid yourself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I don&rsquo;t know. We will see about that bimeby.
He used me fair, and I don&rsquo;t wish him any harm; but I hate
his principles. Well, just then, Tom, when I had got my accounts
squared, the rascals took my vessel, and sunk it in the channel to
keep the Union fleet out. My pipe was out then, and I
couldn&rsquo;t do any thing more. I hung round the city of Norfolk
till I saw there was no chance to get out in that direction; and
then I left. I was up near Bull Run&mdash;the rebels call it
Manassas&mdash;when the battle was fought; but our folks got licked
so badly, that it was no use to try to get through there.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I tried half a dozen times to crawl through, and had
nearly starved to death in the woods; but some rebel cavalry
pickets spied me out, called me a traitor, and sent me back. My
money was all gone by this time, and I went over to Norfolk again.
Your uncle Wyman told me I had better keep quiet where I was, for
just as sure as his name was Somers, the North would all fall to
pieces in less than six months. He expected the rebel army would be
in New York afore long, and I should be a great deal better off
where I was. He tried to get a pass to send me through the rebel
lines, but he couldn&rsquo;t do it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Things went on in this way till your uncle Wyman went to
Charleston on business, and I haven&rsquo;t seen him from that day
to this. The rebels tried to make me go into their navy, but I
wouldn&rsquo;t do it, of course; but when I couldn&rsquo;t do any
other way, I went into the army, hoping I should be sent to the
front, and find a chance to get away. I&rsquo;ve been watching ever
since, but I never happened to get within twenty miles of the Union
pickets before. But here I am, and I&rsquo;m perfectly satisfied
with the past, though I&rsquo;ve suffered a good deal in one way
and another.&rdquo;</p>
<p>By the time Captain Somers had finished his narrative, the party
arrived at the camp. Tom was reprimanded very gently for detaching
himself from the main body of the regiment; but when he reported
the events of his excursion, as he had safely returned with his
command, nothing more was said about his adventure.</p>
<p>At the camp the Union refugee was provided with comfortable
clothing; his hair and beard were trimmed down to decent
proportions, and he was otherwise purged of the barbarisms of the
rebel camp. But even then he did not look like the stout, hearty,
healthy Captain Somers who sailed from Boston in the Gazelle nearly
a year before. He was haggard and emaciated from anxiety and
semi-starvation.</p>
<p>Captain Somers was warmly welcomed by the members of Company K,
who came from Pinchbrook; and when his physical wants had been
satisfied, he was sent to General Hooker, to communicate to him
such intelligence as he possessed in regard to the position and
numbers of the rebel army. He remained at the camp but two days, at
the end of which time he was sent to Washington, and from there
hastened to his home in Pinchbrook. A letter from Tom, announcing
the joyful intelligence of his return, had preceded him.</p>
<p>In ten days after parting with his father, the sergeant received
a full and glowing account of the reception of Captain Somers, who
became quite a lion in Pinchbrook for the time being. He received
his money as he passed through New York, though not without the aid
of a government order which he had procured in Washington, and only
the amount that was actually due to him, for uncle Wyman&rsquo;s
funds were then in process of being confiscated.</p>
<p>The only drawback upon his father&rsquo;s happiness was the
absence of John, who had been drafted into a vessel bound to the
South. He had not seen him for a year, and another year would
probably elapse before he could expect to realize this pleasure.
But the captain&rsquo;s patriotism had been intensified a hundred
fold by his bitter experience in Virginia; and while his twin sons
were gallantly serving their country in the army and the navy, he
was willing to sacrifice the yearnings of his paternal heart, and
he hoped and prayed that they might do their duty faithfully.</p>
<p>Tom&rsquo;s regiment remained on the Potomac but a short time
after the event we have related. Sharper and sterner experience was
before these tried soldiers, and the first indications of active
service were greeted with joyous enthusiasm. Suddenly the camp was
broken up, and the order to march given. The men wondered and
speculated upon their destination, and though the prophets of the
regiments gave them certain information in regard to the direction
they were to take, most of them were incredulous. One declared they
were going to Richmond by the way of Fredericksburg; another, by
the way of Manassas; and a third was positive, from hints he had
seen in the newspapers, that they were going down the valley of the
Shenandoah, to take the capital of Rebeldom on the flank and
rear.</p>
<p>While the prophets and wise men were speculating, the regiment
marched on; and to the astonishment of all, and to the utter
confusion of the seers, they were embarked in a transport&mdash;the
steamer Napoleon&mdash;bound no one knew where. One regiment and
half of another belonging to the brigade were huddled on board of
this one steamer. Every foot of standing room was occupied, and, of
course, the boys were not very comfortably quartered; but, as Tom
expressed it, there was music ahead, and the brave hearts on board
were ready to stand any thing if they could only get a fight out of
the rebels. The mortification of their defeat at Bull Run still
hung heavily on their spirits, and they were panting for an
opportunity to retaliate upon the foe, and win the laurels they had
lost upon that disastrous field.</p>
<p>The prophets, though their failure to foretell the coming event
had cast them into disgrace, were still ready to volunteer an
opinion. They declared that the transports were bound to North
Carolina, to follow up Burnside&rsquo;s successes; but most of the
men were content to wait till the future should develop itself.</p>
<p>The troops were eager for active duty, and if they could get
into the field and strike a heavy blow at the rebellion, they did
not care where it was. They had unbounded confidence in the young
general who was to organize victory for them, and they were willing
to obey orders, and leave every thing to him.</p>
<p>It &ldquo;thundered all around&rdquo; them. Roanoke, Pea Ridge,
Newbern, Winchester, Donelson, were a succession of Union
victories, which inspired them with zeal and courage to endure all
hardships, and face any peril which might be in their path.</p>
<p>The transport descended the Potomac, and came to anchor in the
bay, where they lay one day; the steamer then continued on her
course, and landed her troops in Cheseman&rsquo;s Creek, an
indentation of the peninsula between the York and James Rivers.
After lying in camp a few days, they marched again, and Tom learned
that the regiment was before Yorktown, which had been strongly
fortified by the rebels to resist the advance of the Union
army.</p>

<h2>The Battle of Williamsburg.</h2>
<p class="returnTOC"><a href="#Contents">Return to Table of
Contents</a></p>
<p>What the army of the Potomac achieved and suffered before
Yorktown, we must leave for the historian. Our soldier boy was only
one hero among thousands who toiled in the soft mud of the early
spring, who watched and waited for the tremendous events which have
now passed into history, and whose actors will be honored and
remembered by future generations.</p>
<p>Tom Somers bore his full share of the trials and hardships of
that eventful period; and when McClellan&rsquo;s scientific
engineering had driven the rebels from their strong works without a
struggle to retain them, he moved forward with the gallant army.
&ldquo;On to Richmond!&rdquo; again sounded along the lines, and
the soldiers toiled through mud and mire, hoping and expecting to
strike the final blow that would crush out the rebellion.</p>
<p>Yorktown was evacuated. The rebels were fleeing from their
frowning batteries, and the order came for Hooker&rsquo;s division
to join in the pursuit. At noon the brigade&mdash;now under command
of General Grover commenced its forward movement.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Rather rough,&rdquo; said Hapgood, as the regiment
struggled on through the mire. &ldquo;Rather soft, I think,&rdquo;
replied Tom, laughing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope we haven&rsquo;t got to march far through this
mud,&rdquo; added Ben Lethbridge.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That will depend upon how soon we come up with the
rebels. If it rests with Hooker, I tell you he will get a fight out
of the rebs, if such a thing is possible.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After the regiment had marched five or six miles, the order came
to halt; and the intelligence passed along the column that the
cavalry had come up with the enemy, and were waiting the arrival of
an infantry force to assist in the attack.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good!&rdquo; shouted Tom. &ldquo;We shall have a battle
before night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps not,&rdquo; added Hapgood. &ldquo;It takes the
cat a good while to catch the mouse, even after she smells the
critter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t we march? What are we stopping here
for?&rdquo; said Tom, impatiently.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They say Smith&rsquo;s division has got in ahead of us.
Keep cool, Tom; never be in a hurry for a battle. Some of us that
stand here now won&rsquo;t be alive in twenty-four hours from now;
for I don&rsquo;t believe the rebs are going to let us have it all
our own way,&rdquo; said the veteran.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nor I,&rdquo; added Fred Pemberton. &ldquo;I shall be
killed in this fight.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How do you know, Fred?&rdquo; demanded Hapgood,
sternly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course I don&rsquo;t know, but I feel it in my bones
that I shall fall in the first battle.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your bones ain&rsquo;t no guide at all. I know something
about this business, and I&rsquo;ve seen croakers afore to-day.
Don&rsquo;t talk about being killed, or even hit. Be ready to die,
do your duty like a soldier, and leave all the rest to your
Maker,&rdquo; said the veteran, solemnly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t have any such feeling as that. I know I
shan&rsquo;t be killed,&rdquo; laughed Ben. &ldquo;The bullet
hasn&rsquo;t been cast yet that will stop my wind.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps it has, my boy. It may be in some rebel
soldier&rsquo;s cartridge box over yonder, even now. I tell you,
boys, you don&rsquo;t know any thing about it. Just afore we went
in at Cerry Gordy, a feller by my side said the same thing you did,
Ben; and he was the first man that went down. I tried to pick him
up, and do something for him, but he was stone dead. I tell you,
Ben, you don&rsquo;t know any thing about it. Leave it all to the
Almighty.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pooh, uncle!&rdquo; sneered Ben, trying to laugh down the
solemn words of the old man. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you think
we&rsquo;d better have a prayer meetin&rsquo; before we go
in?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think we should fight the better for it, for he who
trusts in God don&rsquo;t fear death.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But it was evident that the words of Hapgood, especially the
incident of Cerro Gordo, had made a deep impression upon the mind
of the thoughtless young man. Though the division did not move for
three hours, he was very silent and sober. He seemed to feel that
he had been tempting Providence by his bold speech, and even
expressed his regret to Tom for what he had said.</p>
<p>It was dark when the order to march was given. The night was
exceedingly gloomy, and the rain poured down upon the devoted army,
as it moved forward to do its great work. Hour after hour, in the
deep darkness and the pouring rain, the men struggled through the
mire, expecting every moment to be hurled upon the rebel
battalions, or to meet the impetuous onset of the foe.</p>
<p>Between ten and eleven, when the men were nearly worn out by the
exhausting labors of the march, they were ordered to halt in the
road, and bivouac for the rest of the night. What a time and what a
place for repose! They could only wrap themselves up in their wet
blankets, and stretch themselves upon the ground, soaked with
water, and with the rain still pouring down upon them. But they
slept, and enjoyed their rest, for Nature was imperative in her
demands.</p>
<p>At daylight the march was resumed; for the intrepid Hooker, ever
faithful to the trust confided to him, was wholly in earnest. At
half-past five the column was halted in the woods. The rebel works
before Williamsburg were in sight, and General Hooker rode to the
front to examine the position of the enemy.</p>
<p>In front of the rebel batteries, and on each side of the roads,
the trees had been felled, in order to give the guns in the field
works full play upon an approaching force.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hurrah!&rdquo; shouted some of the boys on the right of
the column. &ldquo;Our brigade is to commence the
attack.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How do you know?&rdquo; growled Hapgood, who did not
think a soldier ought to know any thing about the plan of the
battle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are ordered to move,&rdquo; replied Tom. &ldquo;I
suppose that&rsquo;s all they know about it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The prophets on the right were correct this time, for the
regiment was soon sent to the right of the road, and ordered to
deploy as skirmishers. A battery was thrown forward in front of the
felled timber; but before a gun could be fired, two officers and
two privates were seen to fall before the unerring aim of the rebel
sharpshooters, occupying the rifle pits which dotted the cleared
land in front of the forts.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a hot place,&rdquo; said Ben Lethbridge.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We shall all see hot work before the sun goes down
to-night,&rdquo; replied Tom. &ldquo;But let us stand up to it like
men.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the talk, Tom!&rdquo; exclaimed Hapgood.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have you got those socks on, my boy?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have, uncle; and I have the letter and the photograph
in my pocket.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good, Tom! After this day&rsquo;s work is over, you can
write the lady a letter, and tell her that her socks have been in a
battle.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And that I didn&rsquo;t run away in them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The roar of the guns in Fort Magruder interrupted the
conversation. The gunners of the battery in front of them had been
driven from their pieces; but it was almost instantly manned by
volunteers, and a destructive fire poured into the works. Other
batteries were brought up, and the fort was soon silenced. The roar
of battle sounded all along the line; the thunder of cannon and the
crash of musketry reverberated through the woods and over the
plain, assuring the impatient troops that they were engaged in no
trivial affair; that they were fighting a great battle, of which
thousands yet unborn would read upon the pages of history.</p>
<p>Our regiment closed up its lines, and the gallant colonel gave
the order to move forward in the direction of the field works. On,
on, steadily and firmly marched the men of Massachusetts, through
ditch and swamp, through mud and mire, loading, firing, and
charging, as the enemy presented opportunity. The hot work of the
day had commenced; for, from every bush, tree, and covert, which
could conceal a man, the rebels poured a deadly fire into the ranks
of the advancing Federals.</p>
<p>Tom stood as firm as a rock. The doubts and fears which beset
him in his first battle had no existence on this day. So thoroughly
had he schooled his mind to the fearful ordeal of carnage, that he
felt quite at home. He was cool and determined, and continually
encouraged those around him by his cheering words as well as by his
example.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ben is down!&rdquo; exclaimed Hapgood.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Poor fellow!&rdquo; replied Tom, without taking his eye
off the foe in front.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There goes Bob Dornton!&rdquo; added Hapgood.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stand up to it, my men!&rdquo; said Tom, firmly, for he
had no time then to think of the fallen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Forward!&rdquo; shouted the impetuous colonel, who, if he
had never been popular with the men before, was rapidly
establishing himself in their good graces by his unflinching
heroism. &ldquo;Forward! double quick! march!&rdquo;</p>
<p>And on dashed the gallant regiment, mounting the enemy&rsquo;s
lofty works, and driving the foe before them like sheep, at the
point of the bayonet. This was the first experience of this
exciting description which Tom had seen, and he entered into the
spirit of it with a hearty zeal.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Halt!&rdquo; was the order, as a regiment filed out in
front of them, with a flag of truce flying on its front.
&ldquo;Steady&mdash;don&rsquo;t fire,&rdquo; repeated several
officers along the line.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What regiment are you?&rdquo; shouted a person, as the
flag came within speaking distance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What are you?&rdquo; demanded an officer of the storming
party.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re the Alabama eighth!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are the Massachusetts &mdash;th,&rdquo; replied our
men.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then you are the villains we want!&rdquo; returned the
rebel, plentifully interlarding the sentence with oaths.</p>
<p>The flag of truce dropped, and the dastardly foe poured in a
volley of musketry, before which a dozen of our brave boys fell,
either killed or wounded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fire!&rdquo; yelled the colonel; and the order was obeyed
with a will. &ldquo;Charge bayonets! Forward&mdash;double
quick&mdash;march!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The men, burning with indignation at the treachery of the rebel
horde, sprang forward to wreak their righteous vengeance upon the
cowardly traitors. So impetuous was the charge, that the rebel
regiment broke, and sought safety in flight.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Down with them!&rdquo; hoarsely screamed Tom, as the line
swayed forward, and pursued the panic-stricken foe into the woods
on the left. The even line was broken, and the boys scattered to do
their work to the best advantage.</p>
<p>Tom&rsquo;s legs seemed to be in excellent condition,
notwithstanding the toilsome marches of the last twenty-four hours;
and he dashed forward into the woods followed by only a dozen
choice spirits, whose enthusiasm was equal to his own. A squad of
flying rebels in front of them was the object of their present
anxiety, and they soon distanced their companions.</p>
<p>The rebels, seeing by how small a force they were pursued,
rallied and formed line again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Give it to them!&rdquo; cried Tom, as he led his little
force upon the rebels.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hold on, Tom!&rdquo; said Hapgood; &ldquo;we have gone
far enough. There&rsquo;s a rebel regiment forming behind
us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t help it,&rdquo; said Tom, as he rushed
forward, with the veteran by his side. &ldquo;Give it to
them!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tom and his men threw themselves upon the rebel squad, and a
sharp fight ensued, in which the parties fought with bayonets,
clubbed muskets, and even with the death grip upon each
other&rsquo;s throats. The traitors could not stand it, and fled
again.</p>
<p>The sergeant glanced behind him, and saw the rebel regiment
formed ready to charge upon his own. He was cut off from his
friends, with the enemy on his front and rear. Three of his men had
fallen in the sharp encounter with the rebels, and most of them
were wounded or bruised, and all of them out of breath. To add to
the peril of the situation, the squad they had been pursuing were
rallying and being re&euml;nforced by their fugitive
companions.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bad, Tom, bad,&rdquo; said Hapgood, who was puffing and
blowing like a porpoise, as he ominously shook his head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Follow me!&rdquo; said Tom, confidently, as he led the
way in a direction at right angles with the advance of the
party.</p>
<p>Our regiment had reformed again, and soon gave that in front of
them enough to do. The rebels in their rear caused the
sergeant&rsquo;s squad no little annoyance; but they continued on
their course, loading and firing as they retreated.</p>
<h3><a id="Ch_30" name="Ch_30">Chapter XXX.</a></h3>
<h2>More of the Battle.</h2>
<p class="returnTOC"><a href="#Contents">Return to Table of
Contents</a></p>
<p>While Tom and his little command were working their way back to
the Union lines, followed up by the disorganized band of rebels, a
series of most unearthly yells swept over the field, for they had
emerged from the woods. It was the rallying cry of the Confederate
regiment which had formed in their rear. They were charging upon
the Massachusetts &mdash;th; but they might as well have charged
upon the Rock of Gibraltar, for presently Tom was delighted to see
them retiring before the tremendous onslaught of his friends.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hurrah!&rdquo; shouted he, forgetting the foe in his
rear, and pressing forward to that on his front, at the same time
changing his course so as to approach the right wing of the rebel
regiment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be rash, Tom,&rdquo; said the old soldier,
who never permitted the sergeant to leave his side.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Follow me, boys!&rdquo; roared Tom, breathless with
excitement, as he started off on the double quick towards the
breaking lines of the enemy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here we are!&rdquo; replied the gallant fellows behind
him, pushing forward with a zeal equal to that of their leader,
from whom they derived their inspiration. &ldquo;Go in, sergeant,
and we&rsquo;ll stand by you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But the bold soldier boy had discretion as well as gallantry;
and he saw that if he threw his little force upon the rebel line,
the whole party would be instantly annihilated. A covert of bushes
fortunately lay on the right flank of the retreating regiment, and
Tom ordered his men to conceal themselves behind it, until a
favorable moment should arrive to take their places in the
lines.</p>
<p>The men were glad enough to obtain a breathing spell; but, at
such a tremendous moment as that, idleness would have been treason,
for such a glorious opportunity to strike a heavy blow had not
before occurred.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Load up, and fire at will,&rdquo; said Tom, as he charged
his musket. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t throw your lead away
either.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are a dead shot here if we are any where,&rdquo; added
Hapgood, as he and the rest of the party hastily loaded their
muskets.</p>
<p>Pop went Tom&rsquo;s piece first, and over went the rebel at the
extreme right of the rebel regiment. There was no such thing as
missing the mark, for they were on the flank of the Confederate
line, which the united efforts of the officers could hardly
preserve. The men in the covert fired when they were ready; and as
they carefully observed the injunction of Tom not to waste their
lead, every shot told upon the rebels.</p>
<p>The Confederate officers glanced nervously at the clump of
bushes, which glowed with flashes of fire as the sergeant&rsquo;s
little command poured in their volleys; but they were too closely
pressed by the Federals in front to attempt to dislodge them. The
rebel privates were not long in ascertaining what was so clear to
their officers&mdash;that they were flanked, and were being shot
down like sheep, from a quarter where they could not defend
themselves. They had been slowly and doggedly retiring before the
advancing Federals, disputing every inch of ground; but when they
realized that the bolts of death were dropping among them from
another direction, they could no longer endure that awful suspense
which takes possession of the minds of men when they are suspended,
as it were, between life and death.</p>
<p>Tom saw them waver, and he knew what it meant. The rebel line
was just abreast of him, and he had seen at least a score of men
fall before the deadly fire of his party.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Give it to them, boys! They shake!&rdquo; shouted Tom, as
he delivered his fire again. &ldquo;Pour in as fast as you can, but
don&rsquo;t waste your powder.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The men redoubled their exertions, and the rapidity of their
fire was sensibly increased. The effect was soon perceptible in the
rebel ranks; for the right of the line, probably supposing a
company, if not a whole regiment, of sharp-shooters was concealed
in the covert, suddenly broke and fled with the utmost
precipitation, in spite of the gallant efforts of their officers to
rally them.</p>
<p>The Federal regiment instantly took advantage of this partial
panic, and charged furiously upon the rebel line. A desperate
hand-to-hand encounter ensued, during which Tom and his companions
emerged from their concealment, and ran along the rear of the
victorious line. They soon satisfied themselves of what they had
before believed&mdash;that the regiment was their own; and they
lost no time in finding the company to which they belonged. They
joined in the pursuit, which soon ended in the utter rout of the
rebel force.</p>
<p>The position of the enemy&rsquo;s lines did not permit them to
follow the advantage to any great extent, and the order was soon
given to fall back. At this juncture the regiment, which had been
constantly engaged for several hours, was relieved; and not too
early in the day, for the men were completely exhausted by the
furious onslaughts they had made.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who were those men in the bushes on the flank of the
rebel regiment?&rdquo; demanded the colonel, as he reined up his
jaded horse in front of Company K.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sergeant Somers and others,&rdquo; replied Captain
Benson.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Somers again!&rdquo; exclaimed the colonel.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir. They pursued the regiment into the
woods&mdash;the one that showed the flag of truce&mdash;till they
were separated from the rest of us.&rdquo; &ldquo;Forward, Sergeant
Somers,&rdquo; added the colonel.</p>
<p>Tom modestly stepped forward, and he would have blushed if his
face had not been so reddened by his previous exertions as to leave
no room for a deepening of its tint.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You did a big thing, Sergeant Somers. You broke that
rebel line by your steady fire. Sergeant Somers, I thank you and
the men you commanded for your good service.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tom bowed, and the regiment cheered. It was the proudest moment
of his life to be thanked on the field, while the guns were roaring
and the musketry rattling, for the good service he had rendered. It
would form an excellent paragraph for his letter to Lilian Ashford,
especially as he had more than once, in the perils of that exciting
hour, thought of the socks he wore, and of the letter and the
photograph which nestled in his breast pocket, and upon which his
quick throbbing heart was beating the notes of glory and
victory.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We gave you up for lost,&rdquo; said Captain Benson, as
Tom returned to the line.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are safe, thank God!&rdquo; replied Tom, &ldquo;though
three of our number fell in the woods, or on the field where we
were chased by the rebels.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sergeant Somers saved us,&rdquo; added uncle Hapgood.
&ldquo;If he hadn&rsquo;t been as cool as cowcumber, and as stiff
as the mainmast of a frigate, we should have been taken, every one
of us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bravo, Tom!&rdquo; said the captain.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The men stood by me like heroes, or it would have been
all up with the whole of us. They are good fellows, and they
deserve as much credit as I do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The battle continued to rage with increasing fury, till the
roar, and the crash, and the sweep of armed legions beggared
description. Regiments and brigades advanced and fell back with the
varying fortunes of the day, but as yet there was nothing to
indicate the final result.</p>
<p>When the men of our regiment had recovered their breath, an
order came for them to proceed to the left. On their arrival at the
position assigned to them, they were immediately led to the front,
where the batteries which had been pouring a hot fire into the
enemy were in imminent danger of being surrounded. Indeed, the
swoop of the rebel infantry upon the guns had already been made,
and the cannoneers had been driven from their stations. With the
colonel on the right, and the adjutant in command on the left, the
regiment charged upon the foe, as it had twice before charged on
that eventful day, with an enthusiasm bordering upon fury.</p>
<p>The rebels had even spiked one of the guns, and they maintained
their position with an obstinacy which promised the annihilation of
one or the other of the contending forces. A desperate strife
ensued, in which the least perceptible advantage was gained by the
Federals. But if they could do no more, they held the enemy in
check, till the gunners could charge their pieces with grape and
canister, which they poured into the rebels with the most deadly
effect.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hurrah!&rdquo; shouted Tom, as the rebels quaked before
the withering storm of shot belched forth by the guns of the
battery. &ldquo;They shake! Give it to them!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Steady, my men! steady,&rdquo; said Captain Benson.
&ldquo;The ammunition of the battery is expended,&rdquo; he added,
as the cannon ceased their work of destruction. &ldquo;We must hold
these pieces, and every man must do his duty.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ay, ay, sir!&rdquo; replied Tom, vigorously, and the cry
was repeated through the company.</p>
<p>As soon as the guns were thus rendered useless, the enemy swept
down upon the supports again, intent upon capturing the pieces.
They advanced with that terrific yell which is enough of itself to
frighten a nervous man, and with an impetuosity which nothing human
could resist. Our regiment recoiled under the shock; but it was
forced back by the sheer stress of numbers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Rally men! Rally, my brave fellows!&rdquo; shouted the
adjutant, in command of the left wing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stand stiff! Roll them back!&rdquo; roared the
colonel.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Steady, men!&rdquo; added Captain Benson.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, give it to them!&rdquo; screamed Tom, as he plunged
his bayonet into the vitals of the rebel in front of him, and
pushed forward into the very midst of the foe.</p>
<p>The sergeant seemed suddenly to be endowed with the strength of
a giant, and he held his own till Hapgood sprang to his assistance.
The rest of the line, inspired by this daring conduct, rushed
forward, and fell upon the foe with a fury that could not be
resisted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bravo! Bravo, Tom!&rdquo; shouted the captain. &ldquo;Go
in, boys!&rdquo; roared the lieutenant.</p>
<p>And the boys &ldquo;went in,&rdquo; and forced back the rebel
line, and held the guns until another battery with a supply of
ammunition arrived upon the ground to relieve them. The enemy was
again repulsed, and the guns were saved by the unflinching heroism
of our gallant Massachusetts regiment&mdash;another paragraph for
the letter to Lilian Ashford.</p>

<h2>Glory and Victory.</h2>
<p class="returnTOC"><a href="#Contents">Return to Table of
Contents</a></p>
<p>The battle now raged more fiercely than ever, and hotter and
hotter became the fire on every side. The shouts of the enemy
indicated the arrival of re&euml;nforcements.
&ldquo;Johnston!&rdquo; &ldquo;Long-street!&rdquo; resounded over
the field, and roused the rebels to renewed activity. More
certainly was the increase of the enemy&rsquo;s force determined by
the gradual falling back of the brigade at the left of the road;
but the men fought with desperate courage, and yielded not a foot
of ground without enriching it with their best blood.</p>
<p>There were no signs of re&euml;nforcements for over exhausted
troops, though a whole corps was within hearing of the booming guns
that were slaughtering our outnumbered and exhausted brigades. On
the field the aspect began to be dark and unpromising, and Tom
prayed with all his soul that he might be spared the pain of
beholding another defeat, another rout.</p>
<p>Our regiment was ordered to the support of the yielding brigade
on the left. The woods were full of rebels, and the issue of the
conflict in this part of the field was almost hopeless. The enemy
seemed to be inspired by the slight advantage they had gained, and
their yells were fiercer and more diabolical than ever, as they
gathered themselves up for a desperate onslaught.</p>
<p>The Federal brigade was overmatched, and the result seemed to
waver upon a balance; then the equilibrium was slightly disturbed,
and the Union force fell back a little, but only a little, and
doggedly resisted the advance of the foe. It needed but little to
restore the equilibrium, and our regiment, after struggling through
the mud with all attainable speed, arrived upon the spot when the
prospect was so gloomy for the loyal cause.</p>
<p>The men were almost exhausted by the tremendous strain which had
all day long been imposed upon their nervous systems, and by the
physical exertion required of them. But the battle was going
against the North, and they were ready again to make a desperate
effort to redeem the field.</p>
<p>&ldquo;One more of your Massachusetts charges, colonel,&rdquo;
said General Hooker, as the weary soldiers moved up to the
endangered position.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You shall have it, general. My men are always ready,
though they are nearly used up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hancock and Kearney are close by, and if we can hold out
a few minutes longer, all will be well with us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll drive them back, general!&rdquo; shouted the
colonel.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go in, then!&rdquo; added the gallant Hooker, waving his
sword to encourage the soldiers. &ldquo;Forward! You have no time
to lose!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The fiery colonel briefly stated to the regiment the nature of
the work before them, admonished the men to do as they had done all
day, and Massachusetts would be proud of them. A ringing cheer was
the reply to the stirring words of the colonel, and the orders were
given for the advance.</p>
<p>On went the brave fellows like a wall of iron, and precipitated
themselves upon the rebels, buoyant with hope as they followed up
their temporary advantage. The point of attack was all in their
favor, and their exhilarating shouts as they sprang upon the foe
kindled up the expiring enthusiasm of the yielding brigade to whose
assistance they had come. The shock was terrible&mdash;more fearful
and destructive than any which our boys had before experienced.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Steady, my men!&rdquo; shouted Captain Benson.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Give it to them!&rdquo; roared Tom, maddened to
desperation by the awful strife around him, and by seeing so many
of our men fall by his side.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stand up to it!&rdquo; shouted the excited colonel.
&ldquo;They run!&rdquo;</p>
<p>At this moment an inequality of the ground beneath the men of
Company K placed them in a bad position, and the rebels in front of
them, taking advantage of the circumstance, pressed forward, and
actually broke through the line, trampling some of our soldiers
beneath their feet, and transfixing them with their bayonets.</p>
<p>A terrible scene ensued at this gap in the ranks, for the whole
rebel regiment began to press into the weak place. The breach was
made by the side of our sergeant, so that he was not borne down by
the pressure of the rebel battalion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Close up!&rdquo; yelled Tom. &ldquo;Close up! Hail,
Columbia! and give it to them!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Drawing a revolver which he had been permitted to retain after
the capture of the contraband craft on the Potomac, he discharged
its six barrels into the foremost of the assailants; and Hapgood
and Fred Pemberton, who were armed in like manner from the same
source, imitated the example of the sergeant.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now give them the bayonet, boys!&rdquo; screamed Tom,
hoarsely, as he plunged into the midst of the rebels.</p>
<p>The men on the other side of the gap pushed forward with equal
energy, and the ranks closed up again over a pile of dead and
wounded rebels, and Federals, who had fallen in that sharp
encounter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bravo!&rdquo; shouted General Hooker, whose attention had
been drawn to the break in the line. &ldquo;Bravo, sergeant! You
shall have a commission! Forward, my brave boys! Massachusetts sees
you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Up and at them,&rdquo; cried Tom, as the rebels began to
yield and break before the tremendous charge of our regiment.</p>
<p>The young sergeant&rsquo;s throat was raw with the shouting he
had done, and his limbs were beginning to yield to the fatigues of
the day; but the words of the commander of the division made him
over new again, and his husky voice still rang along the line, full
of new courage and new energy to his exhausted comrades. The rebels
were driven back for the time, and fled before the iron masses that
crowded upon them.</p>
<p>The regiment was recalled, and the weary troops, now almost
decimated by the slaughter which had taken place in their ranks,
were permitted to breathe once more.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is awful,&rdquo; said the veteran of Company K,
panting from the violence of his exertions. &ldquo;I never saw any
thing like this before.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nor I,&rdquo; replied Tom, dropping upon the ground with
exhaustion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know something about this business. I thought Cerry
Gordy was consid&rsquo;able of a battle, but &rsquo;twas
nothin&rsquo; like this.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s awful,&rdquo; sighed Tom, as he thought of the
good fellows he had seen fall upon the field.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Heaps of our boys have gone down!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Attention&mdash;battalion!&rdquo; came ringing with
startling effect along the line, in the familiar tones of the
intrepid colonel.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If we win the day, we can afford to lose many. Victory or
death!&rdquo; shouted Tom, as he sprang to his feet, in obedience
to the command. &ldquo;More work for us!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How do you feel, Tom?&rdquo; demanded the veteran, as
they sprang into the line.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right,&rdquo; replied Tom, with a forced buoyancy of
spirits.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you sure, my boy?&rdquo; continued the veteran,
gazing with deep anxiety into the face of the sergeant.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m first rate, uncle. I think I can stand it as
long as any body else.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have done wonders to-day, Tom. I&rsquo;m proud of
you, but I&rsquo;m afeared you are doing too much. If you are used
up, it wouldn&rsquo;t be any disgrace for you to go to the rear.
After what you&rsquo;ve done, nobody will say a word. Don&rsquo;t
kill yourself, Tom, but go to the rear.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I go to the rear!&rdquo; exclaimed Tom, with
indignation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you are disabled, I mean, of course,&rdquo; apologized
the veteran.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not disabled. If I go to the rear with these
socks on, it won&rsquo;t be till after the breath has left my
body.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Socks!&rdquo; replied Hapgood, with a sneer.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afeared that gal will be the death of
you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t sulk in these socks,&rdquo; replied Tom,
with a faint smile, as the regiment moved off on the double quick
to some new position of peril.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The rebels are flanking us!&rdquo; shouted an officer in
another command, as our regiment hurried forward to the endangered
point.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what we are wanted for,&rdquo; said
Hapgood.</p>
<p>The enemy had nearly accomplished their purpose when our gallant
colonel and his jaded force reached the left of the line, and in a
few moments more would have poured a flanking fire into our devoted
battalions, which were struggling with terrible energy to roll back
the pressure in front of them.</p>
<p>The colonel had his men well in hand, and he manoeuvred them
with consummate skill, so as to bring them advantageously to the
work they were to perform. The regiment was hurled against the head
of the flanking column, and the boys rushed forward with that dash
and spirit which had characterized their conduct half a score of
times before in various parts of the field.</p>
<p>Tom&rsquo;s muscles had become loose and soft after the long
continued strain upon them, and if his soul had not been ten times
as big as his body, he must have sunk under the exhaustion of the
day. Another desperate onslaught was required of the men of our
regiment, and commanding all his energies, Tom braced himself up
once more for the fearful struggle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How do you feel now, Tom?&rdquo; demanded the anxious
veteran, as he bit off the cartridge, and rammed it home.</p>
<p>&ldquo;First rate, uncle!&rdquo; replied Tom, as the regiment
poured a withering volley into the rebel line.</p>
<p>&ldquo;For Heaven&rsquo;s sake, Tom, don&rsquo;t kill
yourself,&rdquo; added the old man, as they loaded up again.
&ldquo;Your knees shake under you now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you think I&rsquo;m afraid, uncle?&rdquo; demanded the
sergeant with a grim smile.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, no, Tom; of course I don&rsquo;t think any thing of
the kind. I&rsquo;m afeared you&rsquo;ll bust a blood-vessel, or
something of that sort.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If I do, I&rsquo;ll let you know, uncle.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Charge bayonets! Double quick&mdash;march!&rdquo; rang
along the line.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have at them!&rdquo; cried Tom, who was always the first
to catch the orders of the commanding officer. &ldquo;Down with
them! Give &rsquo;em Yankee Doodle, Hail, Columbia, and the Red,
White, and Blue.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The advancing column, shaken by the furious fire of our
regiment, recoiled before the shock. Slowly the foe fell back,
leaving heaps of their slain upon the hotly-contested ground. Our
boys halted, and poured in another destructive volley.</p>
<p>The Confederate officers rallied their men, and, maddened by the
check they had received, drove them forward to recover the lost
ground.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Once more, boys! Give it to &rsquo;em again,&rdquo; cried
Tom, as the order to advance was repeated.</p>
<p>His words were only representations of his actions; for, as he
spoke, he rushed on a little in front of his comrades, who,
however, pressed forward to keep up with him. He did not exceed the
orders of his superior, but he was one of the promptest to obey
them. On dashed the regiment, and again the rebel line recoiled,
and soon broke in spite of the admirable efforts of their officers
to keep them steady.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Kearney! Kearney! Kearney is here!&rdquo; shouted the
weary heroes in various parts of the field.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Down with them!&rdquo; roared Tom, as the inspiring words
rang in his ears. &ldquo;Down with them! Kearney has come, and the
day is ours!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He had scarcely uttered the words, and sprung forward, before he
was seen to drop upon the ground, several paces in front of the
line, though the undaunted old Hapgood was close by his side. The
enemy had fled; the danger of being flanked was averted; and when
Kearney&rsquo;s men dashed on the field, the sad-hearted veteran,
assisted by Fred Pemberton, bore the silent form of the gallant
sergeant to the rear.</p>
<p>Kearney and Hancock rushed gallantly to the rescue of the
exhausted troops, and Hooker&rsquo;s division was ordered to the
rear to act as a reserve. The strife raged with unabated fury as
those who had borne the brunt of the battle slowly fell back to
give place to the fresh legions.</p>
<p>Poor Tom was tenderly carried by the wiry veteran and his
friends to the surgeon&rsquo;s quarters in the rear. There were
tears in the eyes of the old man as he laid the silent form of his
<em>prot&eacute;g&eacute;</em> upon the wet ground. There he sat by
his charge, sorrowful beyond expression, till tremendous shouts
rent the air. Tom opened his eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Glory and Victory!&rdquo; shouted he, in husky tones, as
he sprang to his feet.</p>
<h3><a id="Ch_32" name="Ch_32">Chapter XXXII.</a></h3>
<h2>Honorable Mention.</h2>
<p>The surgeon examined Tom&rsquo;s wound, and found that he had
been struck by a bullet over the left temple. The flesh was torn
off, and if the skull was not fractured, it had received a
tremendous hard shock. It was probably done at the instant when he
turned to rally the men of Company K, and the ball glanced under
the visor of his cap, close enough to scrape upon his skull, but
far enough off to save his brains. Half an inch closer, and the
bullet would have wound up Tom&rsquo;s earthly career.</p>
<p>The shock had stunned him, and he had dropped like a dead man,
while the profusion of blood that came from the wound covered his
face, and his friends could not tell whether he was killed or not.
He was a pitiable object as he lay on the ground by the
surgeon&rsquo;s quarters; but the veteran soon assured himself that
his young charge was not dead.</p>
<p>Hapgood washed the gore from his face, and did what he could in
his unscientific manner; and probably the cold water had a salutary
effect upon the patient, for when Hancock and Kearney had completed
their work, and the cry of victory rang over the bloody field, he
was sufficiently revived to hear the inspiring tones of triumph.
Leaping to his feet, faint and sick as he was, he took up the cry,
and shouted in unison with the victors upon the field.</p>
<p>But he had scarcely uttered the notes of glory and victory
before his strength deserted him, and he would have dropped upon
the ground if he had not been caught by Hapgood. He groaned heavily
as he sank into the arms of his friend, and yielded to the
faintness and exhaustion of the moment.</p>
<p>The surgeon said the wound was not a very bad one, but that the
patient was completely worn out by the excessive fatigues of march
and battle. In due time he was conveyed to the college building in
Williamsburg, where hundreds of his companions in arms were
suffering and dying of their wounds. He received every attention
which the circumstances would permit. Hapgood, by sundry vigorous
applications at headquarters, was, in consideration of his own and
his <em>prot&eacute;g&eacute;&rsquo;s</em> good conduct on the
battle field, permitted to remain with the patient over night.</p>
<p>The sergeant&rsquo;s skull, as we have before intimated, was not
very badly damaged, as physical injuries were measured after the
bloody battle of that day. But his wound was not the only detriment
he had experienced in the trying ordeal of that terrible day. His
constitution had not yet been fully developed; his muscles were not
hardened, and the fatigues of battle and march had a more serious
effect upon him than the ounce of lead which had struck him on the
forehead.</p>
<p>The surgeon understood his case perfectly, and after dressing
his wound, he administered some simple restoratives, and ordered
the patient to go to sleep. On the night of the 3d of May, he had
been on guard duty; on that of the 4th, he had obtained but three
hours&rsquo; sleep; and thus deprived of the rest which a growing
boy needs, he had passed through the fearful scenes of the battle,
in which his energies, mental and physical, had been tasked to
their utmost. He was completely worn out, and in spite of the
surroundings of the hospital, he went to sleep, obeying to the
letter the orders of the surgeon.</p>
<p>After twelve hours of almost uninterrupted slumber, Tom&rsquo;s
condition was very materially improved, and when the doctor went
his morning round, our sergeant buoyantly proposed to join his
regiment forthwith.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not yet, my boy,&rdquo; said the surgeon, kindly.
&ldquo;I shall not permit you to do duty for at least thirty days
to come,&rdquo; he added, as he felt the patient&rsquo;s pulse.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I feel pretty well, sir,&rdquo; replied Tom.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, you don&rsquo;t. Your regiment will remain here, I
learn, for a few days, and you must keep quiet, or you will have a
fever.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t feel sick, and my head doesn&rsquo;t pain
me a bit.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That may be, but you are not fit for duty. You did too
much yesterday. They say you behaved like a hero, on the
field.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I tried to do my duty,&rdquo; replied Tom, his pale cheek
suffused with a blush.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Boys like you can&rsquo;t stand much of such work as
that. We must fix you up for the next battle; and you shall go into
Richmond with the rest of the boys.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Must I stay in here all the time?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, you may go where you please. I will give you a
certificate which will keep you safe from harm. You can walk about,
and visit your regiment if you wish.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you, doctor.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hapgood had been compelled to leave the hospital before his
patient waked, and Tom had not yet learned any thing in regard to
the casualties of the battle. Armed with the surgeon&rsquo;s
certificate, he left the hospital, and walked to the place where
the steward told him he would find his regiment. Somewhat to his
astonishment he found that he was very weak; and before he had
accomplished half the distance to the camp, he came to the
conclusion that he was in no condition to carry a knapsack and a
musket on a long march. But after resting himself for a short time,
he succeeded in reaching his friends.</p>
<p>He was warmly received by his companions, and the veteran of the
company had nearly hugged him in his joy and admiration.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Honorable mention, Tom,&rdquo; said Hapgood. &ldquo;You
will be promoted as true as you live.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;O, I guess not,&rdquo; replied Tom, modestly. &ldquo;I
didn&rsquo;t do any more than any body else. At any rate, you were
close by my side, uncle.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, but I followed, and you led. The commander of the
division says you shall be a lieutenant. He said so on the field,
and the colonel said so to-day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think I deserve it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do; and if you don&rsquo;t get a commission, then there
ain&rsquo;t no justice left in the land. I tell you, Tom, you shall
be a brigadier if the war lasts only one year more.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;O, nonsense, uncle!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, if you ain&rsquo;t, you ought to be.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m lucky to get out alive. Whom have we lost,
uncle?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A good many fine fellows.&rdquo; replied Hapgood, shaking
his head, sadly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Poor Ben dropped early in the day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I was afraid he&rsquo;d got most to the end of his
chapter afore we went in. Poor fellow! I&rsquo;m sorry for him, and
sorry for his folks.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fred Pemberton said he should be killed, and Ben said he
should not, you remember.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, and that shows how little we know about these
things.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bob Dornton was killed, too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, he&rsquo;s badly hurt, but the surgeon thinks he will
git over it. The cap&rsquo;n was slightly wounded.&rdquo; And
Hapgood mentioned the names of those in the company who had been
killed or wounded, or were missing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was an awful day,&rdquo; sighed Tom, when the old man
had finished the list. &ldquo;There will be sad hearts in
Pinchbrook when the news gets there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So there will, Tom; but we gained the day. We did
something handsome for &lsquo;Old Glory,&rsquo; and I s&rsquo;pose
it&rsquo;s all right.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I would rather have been killed than lost the
battle.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So would I; and betwixt you and me, Tom, you didn&rsquo;t
come very fur from losing your number in the mess,&rdquo; added the
veteran, as he thrust his little fingers into a bullet hole in the
breast of Tom&rsquo;s coat. &ldquo;That was rather a close
shave.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I felt that one, but I hadn&rsquo;t time to think about
it then, for it was just as we were repelling that flank
movement,&rdquo; replied Tom, as he unbuttoned his coat, and thrust
his hand into his breast pocket. &ldquo;Do you suppose she will
give me another?&rdquo; he added, as he drew forth the envelope
which contained the letter and the photograph of the author of his
socks.</p>
<p>A minie ball had found its way through the envelope, grinding a
furrow through the picture, transversely, carrying away the chin
and throat of the young lady. The letter was mangled and minced up
beyond restoration. Tom had discovered the catastrophe when he
waked up in the hospital, for his last thought at night, and his
first in the morning, had been the beautiful Lilian Ashford. He was
sad when he first beheld the wreck; but when he thought what a
glorious assurance this would be of his conduct on the field, he
was pleased with the idea; and while in his heart he thanked the
rebel marksman for not putting the bullet any nearer to the vital
organ beneath the envelope, he was not ungrateful for the splendid
testimonial he had given him of his position during the battle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course she&rsquo;ll give you another. Won&rsquo;t she
be proud of that picture when she gets it back?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If I had been a coward, I couldn&rsquo;t have run away
with those socks on my feet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tom remained with the regiment several hours, and then, in
obedience to the surgeon&rsquo;s orders, returned to the hospital,
where he wrote a letter to his father, containing a short account
of the battle, and another to Lilian Ashford, setting forth the
accident which had happened to the picture, and begging her to send
him another.</p>
<p>I am afraid in this last letter Tom indulged in some moonshiny
nonsense; but we are willing to excuse him for saying that the
thought of the beautiful original of the photograph and the
beautiful author of his socks had inspired him with courage on the
battle field, and enabled him faithfully to perform his duty, to
the honor and glory of the flag beneath whose starry folds he had
fought, bled, and conquered, and so forth. It would not be
unnatural in a young man of eighteen to express as much as this,
and, we are not sure that he said any more.</p>
<p>The next day Tom was down with a slow fever, induced by fatigue
and over-exertion. He lay upon his cot for a fortnight, before he
was able to go out again; but he was frequently visited by Hapgood
and other friends in the regiment. About the middle of the month,
the brigade moved on, and Tom was sad at the thought of lying idle,
while the glorious work of the army was waiting for true and tried
men.</p>
<p>Tom received &ldquo;honorable mention&rdquo; in the report of
the colonel, and his recommendation, supported by that of the
general of the division, brought to the hospital his commission as
second lieutenant.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here&rsquo;s medicine for you,&rdquo; said the chaplain,
as he handed the patient a ponderous envelope.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is it, sir?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know, but it has an official
look.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The sergeant opened it, and read the commission, duly signed by
the governor of Massachusetts, and countersigned and sealed in
proper form. Tom was astounded at the purport of the document. He
could hardly believe his senses; but it read all right, and dated
from the day of the battle in which he had distinguished himself.
This was glory enough, and it took Tom forty-eight hours thoroughly
to digest the contents of the envelope.</p>
<p><em>Lieutenant Somers</em>! The words had a queer sound, and he
could not realize that he was a commissioned officer. But he came
to a better understanding of the subject the next day, when a
letter from Lilian Ashford was placed in his hands. It was actually
addressed to &ldquo;Lieutenant Thomas Somers.&rdquo; She had read
of his gallant conduct and of his promotion on the battle field in
the newspapers. She sent him two photographs of herself, and a
sweet little letter, begging him to return the photograph which had
been damaged by a rebel bullet.</p>
<p>Of course Tom complied with this natural request; but, as the
surgeon thought his patient would improve faster at home than in
the hospital, he had procured a furlough of thirty days for him,
and the lieutenant decided to present the photograph in person.</p>
<h3><a id="Ch_33" name="Ch_33">Chapter XXXIII.</a></h3>
<h2>Lieutenant Somers and Others.</h2>
<p>Tom Somers had been absent from home nearly a year; and much as
his heart was in the work of putting down the rebellion, he was
delighted with the thought of visiting, even for a brief period,
the loved ones who thought of and prayed for him in the little
cottage in Pinchbrook. I am not quite sure that the well-merited
promotion he had just received did not have some influence upon
him, for it would not have been unnatural for a young man of
eighteen, who had won his shoulder-straps by hard fighting on a
bloody field, to feel some pride in the laurels he had earned. Not
that Tom was proud or vain; but he was moved by a lofty and noble
ambition. It is quite likely he wondered what the people of
Pinchbrook would say when he appeared there with the straps upon
his shoulders.</p>
<p>Of course he thought what his father would say, what his mother
would say, and he could see the wrinkled face of gran&rsquo;ther
Greene expand into a genial smile of commendation. It is quite
possible that he had even more interest in his reception at No
&mdash;&mdash; Rutland Street, when he should present himself to
the author and finisher of those marvellous socks, which had
wielded such an immense influence upon their wearer in camp and on
the field. Perhaps it was a weakness on the part of the soldier
boy, but we are compelled to record the fact that he had faithfully
conned his speech for that interesting occasion. He had supposed
every thing she would say, and carefully prepared a suitable reply
to each remark, adorned with all the graces of rhetoric within his
reach.</p>
<p>With the furlough in his pocket, Tom obtained his order for
transportation, and with a light heart, full of pleasant
anticipations, started for home. As he was still dressed in the
faded and shattered uniform of a non-commissioned officer, he did
not attract any particular notice on the way. He was enabled to
pass through Baltimore, Philadelphia, and New York, without being
bored by a public reception, which some less deserving heroes have
not been permitted to escape. But the people did not understand
that Tom had a second lieutenant&rsquo;s commission in his pocket,
and he was too modest to proclaim the fact, which may be the reason
why he was suffered to pass through these great emporiums of trade
without an escort, or other demonstration of respect and
admiration.</p>
<p>Tom&rsquo;s heart jumped with strange emotions when he arrived
at Boston, perhaps because he was within a few miles of home;
possibly because he was in the city that contained Lilian Ashford,
for boys will be silly in spite of all the exertions of parents,
guardians, and teachers, to make them sober and sensible. Such
absurdities as &ldquo;the air she breathes,&rdquo; and other
rhapsodies of that sort, may have flitted through his mind; but we
are positive that Tom did not give voice to any such nonsense, for
every body in the city was a total stranger to him, so far as he
knew. Besides, Tom had no notion of appearing before the original
of the photograph in the rusty uniform he wore; and as he had to
wait an hour for the Pinchbrook train, he hastened to a
tailor&rsquo;s to order a suit of clothes which would be
appropriate to his new dignity.</p>
<p>He ordered them, was duly measured and had given the tailor his
promise to call for the garments at the expiration of five days,
when the man of shears disturbed the serene current of his
meditations by suggesting that the lieutenant should pay one half
of the price of the suit in advance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is a custom we adopt in all our dealings with
strangers,&rdquo; politely added the tailor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I don&rsquo;t propose to take the uniform away until
it is paid for,&rdquo; said Tom, blushing with mortification; for
it so happened that he had not money enough to meet the demand of
the tailor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Certainly not,&rdquo; blandly replied Shears; &ldquo;but
we cannot make up the goods with the risk of not disposing of them.
They may not fit the next man who wants such a suit.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have not the money, sir;&rdquo; and Tom felt that the
confession was an awful sacrifice of dignity on the part of an
officer in the army of the Potomac, who had fought gallantly for
his country on the bloody fields of Williamsburg and Bull Run.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am very sorry, sir. I should be happy to make up the
goods, but you will see that our rule is a reasonable
one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tom wanted to tell him that this lack of confidence was not a
suitable return of a stay-at-home for the peril and privation he
had endured for him; but he left in disgust, hardly replying to the
flattering request of the tailor that he would call again. With his
pride touched, he walked down to the railroad station to await the
departure of the train. He had hardly entered the building before
he discovered the familiar form of Captain Barney, to whom he
hastened to present himself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, Tom, my hearty!&rdquo; roared the old sea captain,
as he grasped and wrung his hand. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad to see you.
Shiver my mainmast, but you&rsquo;ve grown a foot since you went
away. But you don&rsquo;t look well, Tom.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not very well, sir; but I&rsquo;m improving
very rapidly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How&rsquo;s your wound?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;O, that&rsquo;s almost well.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sit down, Tom. I want to talk with you,&rdquo; said
Captain Barney, as he led the soldier boy to a seat.</p>
<p>In half an hour Tom had told all he knew about the battle of
Williamsburg, and the old sailor had communicated all the news from
Pinchbrook.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tom, you&rsquo;re a lieutenant now, but you haven&rsquo;t
got on your uniform,&rdquo; continued Captain Barney.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, sir,&rdquo; replied Tom, laughing. &ldquo;I went into
a store to order one, and they wouldn&rsquo;t trust me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wouldn&rsquo;t trust <em>you</em>, Tom!&rdquo; exclaimed
the captain. &ldquo;Show me the place, and I&rsquo;ll smash in
their deadlights.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know as I blame them. I was a stranger to
them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, Tom, you mustn&rsquo;t go home without a uniform.
Come with me, and you shall be fitted out at once. I&rsquo;m proud
of you, Tom. You are one of my boys, and I want you to go into
Pinchbrook all taut and trim, with your colors flying.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We haven&rsquo;t time now; the train leaves in a few
moments.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There will be another in an hour. The folks are all well,
and don&rsquo;t know you&rsquo;re coming; so they can afford to
wait.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tom consented, and Captain Barney conducted him to several
stores before he could find a ready-made uniform that would fit
him; but at last they found one which had been made to order for an
officer who was too sick to use it at present. It was an excellent
fit, and the young lieutenant was soon arrayed in the garments,
with the symbolic straps on his shoulder.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bravo, Tom! You look like a new man. There isn&rsquo;t a
better looking officer in the service.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Very likely the subject of this remark thought so too, as he
surveyed himself in the full-length mirror. The old uniform, with
two bullet-holes in the breast of the coat, was done up in a bundle
and sent to the express office, to be forwarded to Pinchbrook.
Captain Barney then walked with him to a military furnishing store,
where a cap, sword, belt, and sash, were purchased. For some reason
which he did not explain, the captain retained the sword himself,
but Tom was duly invested with the other accoutrements.</p>
<p>Our hero felt &ldquo;pretty good,&rdquo; as he walked down to
the station with his friend; but he looked splendidly in his new
outfit, and we are willing to excuse certain impressible young
ladies, who cast an admiring glance at him as he passed down the
street. It was not Tom&rsquo;s fault that he was a handsome young
man; and he was not responsible for the conduct of those who chose
to look at him.</p>
<p>With a heart beating with wild emotion, Tom stepped out of the
cars at Pinchbrook. Here he was compelled to undergo the penalty of
greatness. His friends cheered him, and shook his hand till his arm
ached.</p>
<p>Captain Barney&rsquo;s wagon was at the station, and before
going to his own home, he drove Tom to the little cottage of his
father. I cannot describe the emotions of the returned soldier when
the horse stopped at the garden gate. Leaping from the vehicle, he
rushed into the house, and bolted into the kitchen, even before the
family had seen the horse at the front gate.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How d&rsquo;ye do, mother?&rdquo; cried Tom, as he threw
himself pell-mell into the arms of Mrs. Somers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, Tom!&rdquo; almost screamed she, as she returned his
embrace. &ldquo;How <em>do</em> you do?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pretty well, mother. How do you do, father?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Glad to see you,&rdquo; replied Captain Somers, as he
seized his son&rsquo;s hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bless my soul, Tom!&rdquo; squeaked gran&rsquo;ther
Greene, shaking in every fibre of his frame from the combined
influence of rhapsody and rheumatism.</p>
<p>Tom threw both arms around Jenny&rsquo;s neck, and kissed her
half a dozen times with a concussion like that of a battery of
light artillery.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, Tom! I never thought nothin&rsquo; of seein&rsquo;
you!&rdquo; exclaimed Mrs. Somers. &ldquo;I thought you was sick in
the hospital.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am better now, and home for thirty days.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And got your new rig on,&rdquo; added his father.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Captain Barney wouldn&rsquo;t let me come home without my
shoulder-straps. I met him in the city. He paid the
bills.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll make it all right with him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll pay for it by and by. You know I have over a
hundred dollars a month now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gracious me!&rdquo; ejaculated Mrs. Somers, as she gazed
with admiration upon the new and elegant uniform which covered the
fine form of her darling boy.</p>
<p>Presently Captain Barney came into the house, and for two hours
Tom fought his battles over again, to the great satisfaction of his
partial auditors. The day passed off amid the mutual rejoicings of
the parties; and the pleasure of the occasion was only marred by
the thought, on the mother&rsquo;s part, that her son must soon
return to the scene of strife.</p>
<p>The soldier boy&mdash;we beg his pardon; Lieutenant
Somers&mdash;hardly went out of the house until after dinner on the
following day, when he took a walk down to the harbor, where he was
warmly greeted by all his friends. Even Squire Pemberton seemed
kindly disposed towards him, and asked him many questions in regard
to Fred. Before he went home, he was not a little startled to
receive an invitation to meet some of his friends in the town hall
in the evening, which it was impossible for him to decline.</p>
<p>At the appointed hour, he appeared at the hall, which was filled
with people. The lieutenant did not know what to make of it, and
trembled before his friends as he had never done before the enemies
of his country. He was cheered lustily by the men, and the women
waved their handkerchiefs, as though he had been a general of
division. But his confusion reached the climax when Captain Barney
led him upon the platform, and Mr. Boltwood, a young lawyer
resident in Pinchbrook, proceeded to address him in highly
complimentary terms, reviewing his career at Bull Run, on the
Shenandoah, on the Potomac, to its culmination at Williamsburg, and
concluded by presenting him the sword which the captain had
purchased, in behalf of his friends and admirers in his native
town.</p>
<p>Fortunately for Tom, the speech was long, as he was enabled in
some measure to recover his self-possession. In trembling tones he
thanked the donors for their gift, and promised to use it in
defence of his country as long as a drop of blood was left in his
veins&mdash;highly poetical, but it required strong terms to
express our hero&rsquo;s enthusiasm&mdash;whereat the men and boys
applauded most vehemently, and the ladies flourished their cambrics
with the most commendable zeal. Tom bowed&mdash;bowed
again&mdash;and kept bowing, just as he had seen General McClellan
bow when he was cheered by the troops. As the people would not stop
applauding, Tom, his face all aglow with joy and confusion,
descended from the platform, and took his seat by the side of his
mother.</p>
<p>The magnates of Pinchbrook then made speeches&mdash;except
Squire Pemberton&mdash;about the war, patriotism, gunpowder, and
eleven-inch shot and shells. Every body thought it was &ldquo;a big
thing,&rdquo; and went home to talk about it for the next week.
Tom&rsquo;s father, and mother, and sister, and gran&rsquo;ther
Greene, said ever so many pretty things, and every body was as
happy as happy could be, except that John was not at home to share
in the festivities. Letters occasionally came from the sailor boy,
and they went to him from the soldier boy.</p>
<p>Mrs. Somers was not a little surprised, the next day, to hear
her son announce his intention to take the first train for the
city; but Tom could not postpone his visit to No &mdash;&mdash;
Rutland Street any longer, for he was afraid his uniform would lose
its gloss, and the shoulder-straps their dazzling brilliancy.</p>
<p>Tom&rsquo;s courage had nearly forsaken him when he desperately
rang the bell at the home of Lilian Ashford; and he almost hoped
the servant would inform him that she was not at home. Lilian was
at home, and quaking like a condemned criminal before the gallows,
he was ushered into the presence of the author of his socks.</p>
<p>Stammering out his name he drew from his pocket the battered
photograph and the shattered letter, and proceeded at once to
business. Lilian Ashford blushed, and Tom blushed&mdash;that is to
say, they both blushed. When he had presented his relics, he
ventured to look in her face. The living Lilian was even more
beautiful than the Lilian of the photograph.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dear me! So you are the soldier that wore the socks I
knit,&rdquo; said Lilian; and our hero thought it was the sweetest
voice he ever heard.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am, Miss Ashford, and I did not run away in them
either.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad you did not,&rdquo; added she, with a
musical laugh, which made Tom think of the melody of the spheres,
or some such nonsense.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have to thank you for my promotion,&rdquo; said Tom,
boldly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank me!&rdquo; exclaimed she, her fair blue eyes
dilating with astonishment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The socks inspired me with courage and fortitude,&rdquo;
replied Tom, in exact accordance with the programme he had laid
down for the occasion. &ldquo;I am sure the thought of her who knit
them, the beautiful letter, and the more beautiful photograph,
enabled me to do that which won my promotion.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I declare!&rdquo; shouted Lilian, in a kind of
silvery scream.</p>
<p>Bravo, Tom! you are getting along swimmingly. And he said sundry
other smart things which we have not room to record. He stayed half
an hour, and Lilian begged him to call again, and see her
grandmother, who was out of town that day. Of course he promised to
come, promised to bring his photograph, promised to write to her
when he returned to the army&mdash;and I don&rsquo;t know what he
did not promise, and I hardly think he knew himself.</p>
<p>But the brief dream ended, and Tom went home to Pinchbrook,
after he had sat for his picture. The careless fellow left
Lilian&rsquo;s photograph on the table in his chamber a few days
after, and his mother wanted to know whose it was; and the whole
story came out, and Tom was laughed at, and Jenny made fun of him,
and Captain Barney told him he was a match for the finest girl in
the country. The lieutenant blushed like a boy, but rather enjoyed
the whole thing.</p>
<p>A sad day came at last, and Tom went back to the army. He went
full of hope, and the blessing of the loved ones went with him. He
was received with enthusiasm by his old companions in arms, and
Hapgood&mdash;then a sergeant&mdash;still declared that he would be
a brigadier in due time,&mdash;or, if he was not, he ought to be.
His subsequent career, if not always as fortunate as that portion
which we have recorded, was unstained by cowardice or vice.</p>

copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by

this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with

the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE

defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
